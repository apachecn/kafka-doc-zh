<h3><a id="majordesignelements" href="#majordesignelements">4.1 动机</a></h3>
<p>
    我们设计 Kafka 作为一个统一的平台来处理<a href="#introduction">大公司可能拥有的</a>所有实时数据的推送场景。 要做到这点，我们必须考虑相当广泛的用例。
<p>
    Kafka 必须具有高吞吐量来支持高容量事件流，例如实时日志聚合。
<p>
    Kafka 需要能够正常处理大量的数据积压，以便能够支持来自离线系统的周期性数据加载。
<p>
    这也意味着系统要能够处理低延迟分发，来处理更传统的消息处理的使用场景。
<p>
    我们希望支持分区、分布式、实时处理这些消息推送来创建新的分发推送等特性。由此产生了我们的分区和消费者模式。
<p>
    最后，在数据流被推送到其他数据系统进行服务的情况下，我们要求系统在出现机器故障时必须能够保证容错。
<p>
    为支持这些使用场景，引导着我们设计了许多独特的元素，使得 Kafka 相比传统的消息系统更像数据库日志。我们将在后面的章节中概述设计中的一些要素。
<h3><a id="persistence" href="#persistence">4.2 持久化</a></h3>
<h4><a id="design_filesystem" href="#design_filesystem">不要害怕文件系统！</a></h4>
<p>
    Kafka 对消息的存储和缓存严重依赖于文件系统。人们对于“磁盘速度慢”的普遍印象，使得人们对于持久化的架构能够提供强有力的性能产生怀疑。事实上，磁盘的速度比人们预期的要慢的多，也快得多，这具体取决于磁盘的使用方式；一个设计合理的磁盘架构通常可以和网络一样快。
<p>
    磁盘性能的关键在于硬盘驱动的吞吐量，不再像过去十年一样受限于磁盘的寻址时延。因此，使用6个7200rpm、SATA、RAID-5的磁盘阵列在<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-RAID_drive_architectures">JBOD</a>配置下的线性写入的性能约为600MB/秒，但随机写入的性能仅约为100k/秒，相差6000倍以上。因为线性的读取和写入是磁盘使用模式中最有规律的，并且由操作系统进行了大量的优化。现代操作系统提供了 read-ahead 和 write-behind 技术，read-ahead 是以大的 data block 为单位预先读取数据，而 write-behind 是将多个小型的逻辑写合并成一次大型的物理磁盘写入。关于该问题的进一步讨论可以参考<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1563874"> ACM Queue article</a>，他们发现实际上<a href="http://deliveryimages.acm.org/10.1145/1570000/1563874/jacobs3.jpg">顺序磁盘访问在某些情况下比随机内存访问还要快</a>！
<p>
    为了弥补这种性能差异，现代操作系统在越来越注重使用内存对磁盘进行 cache。现代操作系统主动将所有空闲内存用作 disk caching，代价是在内存回收时性能会有所降低。所有对磁盘的读写操作都会通过这个统一的 cache。如果不使用直接I/O，该功能不能轻易关闭。因此即使进程维护了 in-process cache，该数据也可能会被复制到操作系统的 pagecache 中，所有内容都被存储了两份。
<p>
    此外，Kafka 建立在 JVM 之上，任何了解 Java 内存使用的人都知道两点：
<ol>
    <li>对象的内存开销非常高，通常是所存储的数据的两倍(甚至更多)。</li>
    <li>随着堆中数据的增加，Java 的垃圾回收变得越来越复杂和缓慢。</li>
</ol>
<p>
    受这些因素影响，相比于维护 in-memory cache 或者其他结构，使用文件系统和 pagecache 显得更有优势--我们可以通过自动访问所有空闲内存将可用缓存的容量至少翻倍，并且通过存储紧凑的字节结构而不是独立的对象，有望将缓存容量再翻一番。
    这样使得32GB的机器缓存容量可以达到28-30GB,并且不会产生额外的 GC 负担。此外，即使服务重新启动，缓存依旧可用，而 in-process cache 则需要在内存中重建(重建一个10GB的缓存可能需要10分钟)，否则进程就要从 cold cache 的状态开始(这意味着进程最初的性能表现十分糟糕)。
    这同时也极大的简化了代码，因为所有保持 cache 和文件系统之间一致性的逻辑现在都被放到了 OS 中，这样做比一次性的进程内缓存更准确、更高效。如果你的磁盘使用更倾向于顺序读写，那么 read-ahead 可以有效的使用每次从磁盘中读取到的有用数据预先填充 cache。
<p>
    这里给出了一个非常简单的设计：相比于维护尽可能多的 in-memory cache，并且在空间不足的时候匆忙将数据 flush 到文件系统，我们把这个过程倒过来。所有数据一开始就被写入到文件系统的持久化日志中，而不用在 cache 空间不足的时候 flush 到磁盘。实际上，这表明数据被转移到了内核的 pagecache 中。
<p>
    这种以 pagecache 为中心的设计风格出现在一篇关于 <a href="http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes">Varnish</a> 设计的文章中。
<h4><a id="design_constanttime" href="#design_constanttime">常量时间就足够了</a></h4>
<p>
    消息系统使用的持久化数据结构通常是和 BTree 相关联的消费者队列或者其他用于存储消息源数据的通用随机访问数据结构。BTree 是最通用的数据结构，可以在消息系统能够支持各种事务性和非事务性语义。
虽然 BTree 的操作复杂度是 O(log N)，但成本也相当高。通常我们认为 O(log N) 基本等同于常数时间，但这条在磁盘操作中不成立。磁盘寻址是每10ms一跳，并且每个磁盘同时只能执行一次寻址，因此并行性受到了限制。
因此即使是少量的磁盘寻址也会很高的开销。由于存储系统将非常快的cache操作和非常慢的物理磁盘操作混合在一起，当数据随着 fixed cache 增加时，可以看到树的性能通常是非线性的——比如数据翻倍时性能下降不只两倍。
<p>
所以直观来看，持久化队列可以建立在简单的读取和向文件后追加两种操作之上，这和日志解决方案相同。这种架构的优点在于所有的操作复杂度都是O(1)，而且读操作不会阻塞写操作，读操作之间也不会互相影响。这有着明显的性能优势，由于性能和数据大小完全分离开来——服务器现在可以充分利用大量廉价、低转速的1+TB SATA硬盘。
虽然这些硬盘的寻址性能很差，但他们在大规模读写方面的性能是可以接受的，而且价格是原来的三分之一、容量是原来的三倍。
<p>
在不产生任何性能损失的情况下能够访问几乎无限的硬盘空间，这意味着我们可以提供一些其它消息系统不常见的特性。例如：在 Kafka 中，我们可以让消息保留相对较长的一段时间(比如一周)，而不是试图在被消费后立即删除。正如我们后面将要提到的，这给消费者带来了很大的灵活性。

<h3><a id="maximizingefficiency" href="#maximizingefficiency">4.3 Efficiency</a></h3>
<p>
We have put significant effort into efficiency. One of our primary use cases is handling web activity data, which is very high volume: each page view may generate dozens of writes. Furthermore, we assume each
message published is read by at least one consumer (often many), hence we strive to make consumption as cheap as possible.
我们在性能上已经做了很大的努力. 我们主要的使用场景是处理网络活动数据, 这个数据量非常大, 因为每个页面都有可能大量的写入. 此外我们假设每个发布 message 至少被一个consumer (通常很多个consumer) 消费, 因此我们努力让消费尽可能付出少的
代价.
<p>
We have also found, from experience building and running a number of similar systems, that efficiency is a key to effective multi-tenant operations. If the downstream infrastructure service can easily become a
bottleneck due to a small bump in usage by the application, such small changes will often create problems. By being very fast we help ensure that the application will tip-over under load before the infrastructure.
This is particularly important when trying to run a centralized service that supports dozens or hundreds of applications on a centralized cluster as changes in usage patterns are a near-daily occurrence.
我们还发现, 从构建和运行许多相似系统的经验上来看, 性能是多租户运营的关键. 如果下游的基础设施服务很轻易被应用层冲击形成瓶颈, 那么一些小的改变也会造成问题. 通过非常快的(缓存)技术, 我们能确保应用层冲击基础设施之前, 将负载稳定下来.
当尝试去运行支持集中式集群上成百上千个应用程序的集中式服务时, 这一点很重要, 因为应用层使用方式几乎每天都会发生变化. 
<p>
We discussed disk efficiency in the previous section. Once poor disk access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of inefficiency in this type of system: too many small I/O operations, and
excessive byte copying.
我们在上一节讨论了磁盘性能. 一旦消除了磁盘访问模式不佳的情况, 还有可能导致系统效率低下的两个常见原因是: 太多的小 I/O 操作, 过多的字节复制. 
<p>
The small I/O problem happens both between the client and the server and in the server's own persistent operations.
客户端和服务端之间以及服务端自身的持久化操作都会导致小的 I/O 问题.
<p>
To avoid this, our protocol is built around a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together. This allows network requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the network
roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. The server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.
为了避免这种情况, 我们的协议是建立在一个 "消息块" 抽象的基础上, 合理将消息分组在一起, 这使得网络请求将获得分组信息并分摊网络的开销往返而不是一次发送一条消息. 服务端依次将消息块一次加载到它的日志中, consumer 一次获取大的线性
的消息块.
<p>
This simple optimization produces orders of magnitude speed up. Batching leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks, and so on, all of which allows Kafka to turn
a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes that flow to the consumers.
这个简单的优化将速度提升了数量级. 批处理允许更大的网络数据包, 更大的顺序读写磁盘操作, 连续的内存块等等, 所有这些都使 KafKa 将随机流消息顺序写入到磁盘, 再由 consumers 进行消费 .
<p>
The other inefficiency is in byte copying. At low message rates this is not an issue, but under load the impact is significant. To avoid this we employ a standardized binary message format that is shared by the
producer, the broker, and the consumer (so data chunks can be transferred without modification between them).
另一个低效率的操作是字节复制, 在消息量少时, 这不是问题. 但是在高负载情况下, 影响还是挺大的. 为了避免这种情况, 我们使用 producer , broker , 和 consumer 都能用的标准化的二进制消息格式, 这样数据不用修改就能在他们之间传递. 
<p>
The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer.
Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. Modern unix operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring data
out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>.
broker 维护的消息日志本身就是一个文件目录, 每个文件都是序列化的消息块, 以 producer 和 consumer 所使用格式写入到磁盘. 保持这种通用格式能得到最重要优化方式: 持久日志块的网络传输. 
现代的 unix 操作系统提供了一个高度优化的编码路径,用于将数据从页面缓存转移到套接字; Linux 是这样做的 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>.
<p>
To understand the impact of sendfile, it is important to understand the common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:
为了理解 sendfile 的意义, 了解数据从文件传输到套接字的常见数据路径非常重要:
<ol>
    <li>The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in kernel space 操作系统从磁盘读取数据到内核空间的 pagecache </li>
    <li>The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space buffer  应用程序读取内核空间的数据到用户空间的缓冲区</li>
    <li>The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket buffer  应用程序将数据(用户空间的缓冲区)写回内核空间到套接字缓冲区(内核空间)</li>
    <li>The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the NIC buffer where it is sent over the network 操作系统将数据从套接字缓冲区(内核空间)复制到通过网络发送的 NIC 缓冲区 </li>
</ol>
<p>
This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls. Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send the data from pagecache to the network directly. So in this optimized
path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.
这显然是低效的, 有四个副本和两次系统调用. 使用 sendfile , 通过允许操作系统将数据从 pagecache 直接发送到网络, 这样避免重新复制数据. 所以在这个优化路径,只需要将最终数据拷贝到 NIC 缓冲区.
<p>
We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic. Using the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory
and copied out to user-space every time it is read. This allows messages to be consumed at a rate that approaches the limit of the network connection.
我们期望一个 topic 有多个 consumer 是普遍的使用场景. 使用上述的零复制优化, 数据在使用时只会被复制到 pagecache 中一次, 而不是每次拷贝到用户空间内存,再进行读取. 这使得消息能够以网络连接速度的上限进行消费. 
<p>
This combination of pagecache and sendfile means that on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from cache.
pagecache 和 sendfile 的组合使用意味着,在一个kafka集群中, 大多数 consumer 消费时, 您将看不到磁盘上的读取活动, 因为它们将完全从缓存中提供数据.

<h4><a id="design_compression" href="#design_compression">End-to-end Batch Compression 端到端的批量压缩</a></h4>
<p>
In some cases the bottleneck is actually not CPU or disk but network bandwidth. This is particularly true for a data pipeline that needs to send messages between data centers over a wide-area network. Of course,
the user can always compress its messages one at a time without any support needed from Kafka, but this can lead to very poor compression ratios as much of the redundancy is due to repetition between messages of
the same type (e.g. field names in JSON or user agents in web logs or common string values). Efficient compression requires compressing multiple messages together rather than compressing each message individually.
在某些情况下, 数据传输的瓶颈不是 CPU 或 磁盘, 而是网络带宽. 对于需要通过广域网在数据中心之间发送消息的数据方式尤其如此. 当然, 用户可以在不需要 Kakfa 支持下一个一个的压缩消息. 但是这样会造成非常差的压缩比, 和消息重复类型的冗余, 比如
JSON 中的字段名称或者是或 Web 日志中的用户代理或公共字符串值. 高性能的压缩是一次压缩多个消息, 而不是压缩单个消息.
<p>
Kafka supports this with an efficient batching format. A batch of messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in this form. This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and will
remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the consumer.
Kafka 以高效的批处理格式支持一批消息可以压缩在一起发送到服务器. 这批消息将以压缩格式写入, 并且在日志中保持压缩, 只会在 consumer 消费时解压缩.
<p>
Kafka supports GZIP, Snappy and LZ4 compression protocols. More details on compression can be found <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compression">here</a>.

<h3><a id="theproducer" href="#theproducer">4.4 The Producer</a></h3>

<h4><a id="design_loadbalancing" href="#design_loadbalancing">Load balancing</a></h4>
<p>
The producer sends data directly to the broker that is the leader for the partition without any intervening routing tier. To help the producer do this all Kafka nodes can answer a request for metadata about which
servers are alive and where the leaders for the partitions of a topic are at any given time to allow the producer to appropriately direct its requests.
<p>
The client controls which partition it publishes messages to. This can be done at random, implementing a kind of random load balancing, or it can be done by some semantic partitioning function. We expose the interface
for semantic partitioning by allowing the user to specify a key to partition by and using this to hash to a partition (there is also an option to override the partition function if need be). For example if the key
chosen was a user id then all data for a given user would be sent to the same partition. This in turn will allow consumers to make locality assumptions about their consumption. This style of partitioning is explicitly
designed to allow locality-sensitive processing in consumers.

<h4><a id="design_asyncsend" href="#design_asyncsend">Asynchronous send</a></h4>
<p>
Batching is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send out larger batches in a single request. The batching can be configured
to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms). This allows the accumulation of more bytes to send, and few larger I/O operations on the
servers. This buffering is configurable and gives a mechanism to trade off a small amount of additional latency for better throughput.
<p>
Details on <a href="#producerconfigs">configuration</a> and the <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html">api</a> for the producer can be found
elsewhere in the documentation.

<h3><a id="theconsumer" href="#theconsumer">4.5 消费者</a></h3>

Kafka consumer通过向 broker 发出一个“fetch”请求来获取它想要消费的 partition。consumer 的每个请求都在 log 中指定了对应的 offset，并接收从该位置开始的一大块数据。因此，consumer 对于该位置的控制就显得极为重要，并且可以在需要的时候通过回退到该位置再次消费对应的数据。

<h4><a id="design_pull" href="#design_pull">Push vs. pull</a></h4>
<p>
最初我们考虑的问题是：究竟是由 consumer 从 broker 那里 pull 数据，还是由 broker 将数据 push 到 consumer。Kafka 在这方面采取了一种较为传统的设计方式，也是大多数的消息系统所共享的方式：即 producer 把数据 push 到 broker，然后 consumer 从 broker 中 pull 数据。
也有一些 logging-centric 的系统，比如 <a href="http://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a> 和 <a href="http://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a>，沿着一条完全不同的 push-based 的路径，将数据 push 到下游节点。这两种方法都有优缺点。然而，由于 broker 控制着数据传输速率，
所以 push-based 系统很难处理不同的 consumer。让 broker 控制数据传输速率主要是为了让 consumer 能够以可能的最大速率消费；不幸的是，这导致着在 push-based 的系统中，当消费速率低于生产速率时，consumer 往往会不堪重负（本质上类似于拒绝服务攻击）。push-based 系统有一个很好的特性，
那就是当 consumer 速率落后于 producer 时，可以在适当的时间赶上来。还可以通过使用某种 backoff 协议来减少这种现象：即 consumer 可以通过 backoff 表示它已经不堪重负了，然而通过获得负载情况来充分使用 consumer（但永远不超载）这一方式实现起来比它看起来更棘手。前面以这种方式构建系统的尝试，引导着 Kafka 走向了更传统的 pull 模型。

<p>
另一个 pull-based 系统的优点在于：它可以大批量生产要发送给 consumer 的数据。而 push-based 系统必须选择立即发送请求或者积累更多的数据，然后在不知道下游的 consumer 能否立即处理它的情况下发送这些数据。如果系统调整为低延迟状态，这就会导致一次只发送一条消息，以至于传输的数据不再被缓冲，这种方式是极度浪费的。
而 pull-based 的设计修复了该问题，因为 consumer 总是将所有可用的（或者达到配置的最大长度）消息 pull 到 log 当前位置的后面，从而使得数据能够得到最佳的处理而不会引入不必要的延迟。

<p>
简单的 pull-based 系统的不足之处在于：如果 broker 中没有数据，consumer 可能会在一个紧密的循环中结束轮询，实际上 busy-waiting 直到数据到来。为了避免 busy-waiting，我们在 pull 请求中加入参数，使得 consumer 在一个“long pull”中阻塞等待，直到数据到来（还可以选择等待给定字节长度的数据来确保传输长度）。

<p>
你可以想象其它可能的只基于 pull 的， end-to-end 的设计。例如producer 直接将数据写入一个本地的 log，然后 broker 从 producer 那里 pull 数据，最后 consumer 从 broker 中 pull 数据。通常提到的还有“store-and-forward”式 producer，
这是一种很有趣的设计，但我们觉得它跟我们设定的有数以千计的生产者的应用场景不太相符。我们在运行大规模持久化数据系统方面的经验使我们感觉到，横跨多个应用、涉及数千磁盘的系统事实上并不会让事情更可靠，反而会成为操作时的噩梦。在实践中，
我们发现可以通过大规模运行的带有强大的 SLAs 的 pipeline，而省略 producer 的持久化过程。

<h4><a id="design_consumerposition" href="#design_consumerposition">消费者的位置</a></h4>
令人惊讶的是，持续追踪<i>已经被消费的内容</i>是消息系统的关键性能点之一。

<p>
大多数消息系统都在 broker 上保存被消费消息的元数据。也就是说，当消息被传递给 consumer，broker 要么立即在本地记录该事件，要么等待 consumer 的确认后再记录。这是一种相当直接的选择，而且事实上对于单机服务器来说，也没与其它地方能够存储这些状态信息。
由于大多数消息系统用于存储的数据结构规模都很小，所以这也是一个很实用的选择——因为只要 broker 知道哪些消息被消费了，就可以在本地立即进行删除，一直保持较小的数据量。

<p>
    也许不太明显，但要让 broker 和 consumer 就被消费的数据保持一致性也不是一个小问题。如果 broker 在每条消息被发送到网络的时候，立即将其标记为 <b>consumed</b>，那么一旦 consumer 无法处理该消息（可能由 consumer 崩溃或者请求超时或者其他原因导致），该消息就会丢失。
为了解决消息丢失的问题，许多消息系统增加了确认机制：即当消息被发送出去的时候，消息仅被标记为<b>sent</b> 而不是 <b>consumed</b>；然后 broker 会等待一个来自 consumer 的特定确认，再将消息标记为<b>consumed</b>。这个策略修复了消息丢失的问题，但也产生了新问题。
首先，如果 consumer 处理了消息但在发送确认之前出错了，那么该消息就会被消费两次。第二个是关于性能的，现在 broker 必须为每条消息保存多个状态（首先对其加锁，确保该消息只被发送一次，然后将其永久的标记为 consumed，以便将其移除）。
还有更棘手的问题要处理，比如如何处理已经发送但一直得不到确认的消息。

<p>
Kafka 使用完全不同的方式解决消息丢失问题。Kafka的 topic 被分割成了一组完全有序的 partition，其中每一个 partition 在任意给定的时间内只能被每个订阅了这个 topic 的 consumer 组中的一个 consumer 消费。这意味着 partition 中
每一个 consumer 的位置仅仅是一个数字，即下一条要消费的消息的offset。这使得被消费的消息的状态信息相当少，每个 partition 只需要一个数字。这个状态信息还可以作为周期性的 checkpoint。这以非常低的代价实现了和消息确认机制等同的效果。

<p>
    这种方式还有一个附加的好处。consumer 可以<i>回退</i>到之前的 offset 来再次消费之前的数据，这个操作违反了队列的基本原则，但事实证明对大多数 consumer 来说这是一个必不可少的特性。
例如，如果 consumer 的代码有 bug，并且在 bug 被发现前已经有一部分数据被消费了， 那么 consumer 可以在 bug 修复后通过回退到之前的 offset 来再次消费这些数据。

<h4><a id="design_offlineload" href="#design_offlineload">离线数据加载</a></h4>

    可伸缩的持久化特性允许 consumer 只进行周期性的消费，例如批量数据加载，周期性将数据加载到诸如 Hadoop 和关系型数据库之类的离线系统中。
<p>
在 Hadoop 的应用场景中，我们通过将数据加载分配到多个独立的 map 任务来实现并行化，每一个 map 任务负责一个 node/topic/partition，从而达到充分并行化。Hadoop 提供了任务管理机制，失败的任务可以重新启动而不会有重复数据的风险，只需要简单的从原来的位置重启即可。

<h3><a id="semantics" href="#semantics">4.6 Message Delivery Semantics</a></h3>
<p>
Now that we understand a little about how producers and consumers work, let's discuss the semantic guarantees Kafka provides between producer and consumer. Clearly there are multiple possible message delivery
guarantees that could be provided:
<ul>
<li>
    <i>At most once</i>&mdash;Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.
</li>
<li>
    <i>At least once</i>&mdash;Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.
</li>
<li>
    <i>Exactly once</i>&mdash;this is what people actually want, each message is delivered once and only once.
</li>
</ul>

It's worth noting that this breaks down into two problems: the durability guarantees for publishing a message and the guarantees when consuming a message.
<p>
Many systems claim to provide "exactly once" delivery semantics, but it is important to read the fine print, most of these claims are misleading (i.e. they don't translate to the case where consumers or producers
can fail, cases where there are multiple consumer processes, or cases where data written to disk can be lost).
<p>
Kafka's semantics are straight-forward. When publishing a message we have a notion of the message being "committed" to the log. Once a published message is committed it will not be lost as long as one broker that
replicates the partition to which this message was written remains "alive". The definition of committed message, alive partition as well as a description of which types of failures we attempt to handle will be
described in more detail in the next section. For now let's assume a perfect, lossless broker and try to understand the guarantees to the producer and consumer. If a producer attempts to publish a message and
experiences a network error it cannot be sure if this error happened before or after the message was committed. This is similar to the semantics of inserting into a database table with an autogenerated key.
<p>
Prior to 0.11.0.0, if a producer failed to receive a response indicating that a message was committed, it had little choice but to resend the message. This provides at-least-once delivery semantics since the
message may be written to the log again during resending if the original request had in fact succeeded. Since 0.11.0.0, the Kafka producer also supports an idempotent delivery option which guarantees that resending
will not result in duplicate entries in the log. To achieve this, the broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a sequence number that is sent by the producer along with every message.
Also beginning with 0.11.0.0, the producer supports the ability to send messages to multiple topic partitions using transaction-like semantics: i.e. either all messages are successfully written or none of them are.
The main use case for this is exactly-once processing between Kafka topics (described below).
<p>
Not all use cases require such strong guarantees. For uses which are latency sensitive we allow the producer to specify the durability level it desires. If the producer specifies that it wants to wait on the message
being committed this can take on the order of 10 ms. However the producer can also specify that it wants to perform the send completely asynchronously or that it wants to wait only until the leader (but not
necessarily the followers) have the message.
<p>
Now let's describe the semantics from the point-of-view of the consumer. All replicas have the exact same log with the same offsets. The consumer controls its position in this log. If the consumer never crashed it
could just store this position in memory, but if the consumer fails and we want this topic partition to be taken over by another process the new process will need to choose an appropriate position from which to start
processing. Let's say the consumer reads some messages -- it has several options for processing the messages and updating its position.
<ol>
<li>It can read the messages, then save its position in the log, and finally process the messages. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after saving its position but before saving
the output of its message processing. In this case the process that took over processing would start at the saved position even though a few messages prior to that position had not been processed. This corresponds
to "at-most-once" semantics as in the case of a consumer failure messages may not be processed.
<li>It can read the messages, process the messages, and finally save its position. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after processing messages but before saving its position.
In this case when the new process takes over the first few messages it receives will already have been processed. This corresponds to the "at-least-once" semantics in the case of consumer failure. In many cases
messages have a primary key and so the updates are idempotent (receiving the same message twice just overwrites a record with another copy of itself).
</ol>
<p>
So what about exactly once semantics (i.e. the thing you actually want)? When consuming from a Kafka topic and producing to another topic (as in a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>
application), we can leverage the new transactional producer capabilities in 0.11.0.0 that were mentioned above. The consumer's position is stored as a message in a topic, so we can write the offset to Kafka in the
same transaction as the output topics receiving the processed data. If the transaction is aborted, the consumer's position will revert to its old value and the produced data on the output topics will not be visible
to other consumers, depending on their "isolation level." In the default "read_uncommitted" isolation level, all messages are visible to consumers even if they were part of an aborted transaction,
but in "read_committed," the consumer will only return messages from transactions which were committed (and any messages which were not part of a transaction).
<p>
When writing to an external system, the limitation is in the need to coordinate the consumer's position with what is actually stored as output. The classic way of achieving this would be to introduce a two-phase
commit between the storage of the consumer position and the storage of the consumers output. But this can be handled more simply and generally by letting the consumer store its offset in the same place as
its output. This is better because many of the output systems a consumer might want to write to will not support a two-phase commit. As an example of this, consider a
<a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> connector which populates data in HDFS along with the offsets of the data it reads so that it is guaranteed that either data and
offsets are both updated or neither is. We follow similar patterns for many other data systems which require these stronger semantics and for which the messages do not have a primary key to allow for deduplication.
<p>
So effectively Kafka supports exactly-once delivery in <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>, and the transactional producer/consumer can be used generally to provide
exactly-once delivery when transfering and processing data between Kafka topics. Exactly-once delivery for other destination systems generally requires cooperation with such systems, but Kafka provides the
offset which makes implementing this feasible (see also <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a>). Otherwise, Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default, and allows
the user to implement at-most-once delivery by disabling retries on the producer and committing offsets in the consumer prior to processing a batch of messages.

<h3><a id="replication" href="#replication">4.7 Replication</a></h3>
<p>
Kafka replicates the log for each topic's partitions across a configurable number of servers (you can set this replication factor on a topic-by-topic basis). This allows automatic failover to these replicas when a
server in the cluster fails so messages remain available in the presence of failures.
<p>
Other messaging systems provide some replication-related features, but, in our (totally biased) opinion, this appears to be a tacked-on thing, not heavily used, and with large downsides: slaves are inactive,
throughput is heavily impacted, it requires fiddly manual configuration, etc. Kafka is meant to be used with replication by default&mdash;in fact we implement un-replicated topics as replicated topics where the
replication factor is one.
<p>
The unit of replication is the topic partition. Under non-failure conditions, each partition in Kafka has a single leader and zero or more followers. The total number of replicas including the leader constitute the
replication factor. All reads and writes go to the leader of the partition. Typically, there are many more partitions than brokers and the leaders are evenly distributed among brokers. The logs on the followers are
identical to the leader's log&mdash;all have the same offsets and messages in the same order (though, of course, at any given time the leader may have a few as-yet unreplicated messages at the end of its log).
<p>
Followers consume messages from the leader just as a normal Kafka consumer would and apply them to their own log. Having the followers pull from the leader has the nice property of allowing the follower to naturally
batch together log entries they are applying to their log.
<p>
As with most distributed systems automatically handling failures requires having a precise definition of what it means for a node to be "alive". For Kafka node liveness has two conditions
<ol>
    <li>A node must be able to maintain its session with ZooKeeper (via ZooKeeper's heartbeat mechanism)
    <li>If it is a slave it must replicate the writes happening on the leader and not fall "too far" behind
</ol>
We refer to nodes satisfying these two conditions as being "in sync" to avoid the vagueness of "alive" or "failed". The leader keeps track of the set of "in sync" nodes. If a follower dies, gets stuck, or falls
behind, the leader will remove it from the list of in sync replicas. The determination of stuck and lagging replicas is controlled by the replica.lag.time.max.ms configuration.
<p>
In distributed systems terminology we only attempt to handle a "fail/recover" model of failures where nodes suddenly cease working and then later recover (perhaps without knowing that they have died). Kafka does not
handle so-called "Byzantine" failures in which nodes produce arbitrary or malicious responses (perhaps due to bugs or foul play).
<p>
We can now more precisely define that a message is considered committed when all in sync replicas for that partition have applied it to their log.
Only committed messages are ever given out to the consumer. This means that the consumer need not worry about potentially seeing a message that could be lost if the leader fails. Producers, on the other hand,
have the option of either waiting for the message to be committed or not, depending on their preference for tradeoff between latency and durability. This preference is controlled by the acks setting that the
producer uses.
Note that topics have a setting for the "minimum number" of in-sync replicas that is checked when the producer requests acknowledgment that a message
has been written to the full set of in-sync replicas. If a less stringent acknowledgement is requested by the producer, then the message can be committed, and consumed,
even if the number of in-sync replicas is lower than the minimum (e.g. it can be as low as just the leader).
<p>
The guarantee that Kafka offers is that a committed message will not be lost, as long as there is at least one in sync replica alive, at all times.
<p>
Kafka will remain available in the presence of node failures after a short fail-over period, but may not remain available in the presence of network partitions.

<h4><a id="design_replicatedlog" href="#design_replicatedlog">Replicated Logs: Quorums, ISRs, and State Machines (Oh my!)</a></h4>

At its heart a Kafka partition is a replicated log. The replicated log is one of the most basic primitives in distributed data systems, and there are many approaches for implementing one. A replicated log can be
used by other systems as a primitive for implementing other distributed systems in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">state-machine style</a>.
<p>
A replicated log models the process of coming into consensus on the order of a series of values (generally numbering the log entries 0, 1, 2, ...). There are many ways to implement this, but the simplest and fastest
is with a leader who chooses the ordering of values provided to it. As long as the leader remains alive, all followers need to only copy the values and ordering the leader chooses.
<p>
Of course if leaders didn't fail we wouldn't need followers! When the leader does die we need to choose a new leader from among the followers. But followers themselves may fall behind or crash so we must ensure we
choose an up-to-date follower. The fundamental guarantee a log replication algorithm must provide is that if we tell the client a message is committed, and the leader fails, the new leader we elect must also have
that message. This yields a tradeoff: if the leader waits for more followers to acknowledge a message before declaring it committed then there will be more potentially electable leaders.
<p>
If you choose the number of acknowledgements required and the number of logs that must be compared to elect a leader such that there is guaranteed to be an overlap, then this is called a Quorum.
<p>
A common approach to this tradeoff is to use a majority vote for both the commit decision and the leader election. This is not what Kafka does, but let's explore it anyway to understand the tradeoffs. Let's say we
have 2<i>f</i>+1 replicas. If <i>f</i>+1 replicas must receive a message prior to a commit being declared by the leader, and if we elect a new leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least
<i>f</i>+1 replicas, then, with no more than <i>f</i> failures, the leader is guaranteed to have all committed messages. This is because among any <i>f</i>+1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains
all committed messages. That replica's log will be the most complete and therefore will be selected as the new leader. There are many remaining details that each algorithm must handle (such as precisely defined what
makes a log more complete, ensuring log consistency during leader failure or changing the set of servers in the replica set) but we will ignore these for now.
<p>
This majority vote approach has a very nice property: the latency is dependent on only the fastest servers. That is, if the replication factor is three, the latency is determined by the faster slave not the slower one.
<p>
There are a rich variety of algorithms in this family including ZooKeeper's
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140602093727/http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs347/reading/zab.pdf">Zab</a>,
<a href="https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/download/attachments/11370504/raft.pdf">Raft</a>,
and <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf">Viewstamped Replication</a>.
The most similar academic publication we are aware of to Kafka's actual implementation is
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=66814">PacificA</a> from Microsoft.
<p>
The downside of majority vote is that it doesn't take many failures to leave you with no electable leaders. To tolerate one failure requires three copies of the data, and to tolerate two failures requires five copies
of the data. In our experience having only enough redundancy to tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, but doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and 1/5th the
throughput, is not very practical for large volume data problems. This is likely why quorum algorithms more commonly appear for shared cluster configuration such as ZooKeeper but are less common for primary data
storage. For example in HDFS the namenode's high-availability feature is built on a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1">majority-vote-based journal</a>, but this more
expensive approach is not used for the data itself.
<p>
Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set. Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. Only members of this set
are eligible for election as leader. A write to a Kafka partition is not considered committed until <i>all</i> in-sync replicas have received the write. This ISR set is persisted to ZooKeeper whenever it changes.
Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be elected leader. This is an important factor for Kafka's usage model where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is important.
With this ISR model and <i>f+1</i> replicas, a Kafka topic can tolerate <i>f</i> failures without losing committed messages.
<p>
For most use cases we hope to handle, we think this tradeoff is a reasonable one. In practice, to tolerate <i>f</i> failures, both the majority vote and the ISR approach will wait for the same number of replicas to
acknowledge before committing a message (e.g. to survive one failure a majority quorum needs three replicas and one acknowledgement and the ISR approach requires two replicas and one acknowledgement).
The ability to commit without the slowest servers is an advantage of the majority vote approach. However, we think it is ameliorated by allowing the client to choose whether they block on the message commit or not,
and the additional throughput and disk space due to the lower required replication factor is worth it.
<p>
Another important design distinction is that Kafka does not require that crashed nodes recover with all their data intact. It is not uncommon for replication algorithms in this space to depend on the existence of
"stable storage" that cannot be lost in any failure-recovery scenario without potential consistency violations. There are two primary problems with this assumption. First, disk errors are the most common problem we
observe in real operation of persistent data systems and they often do not leave data intact. Secondly, even if this were not a problem, we do not want to require the use of fsync on every write for our consistency
guarantees as this can reduce performance by two to three orders of magnitude. Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed
data in its crash.

<h4><a id="design_uncleanleader" href="#design_uncleanleader">Unclean leader election: What if they all die?</a></h4>

Note that Kafka's guarantee with respect to data loss is predicated on at least one replica remaining in sync. If all the nodes replicating a partition die, this guarantee no longer holds.
<p>
However a practical system needs to do something reasonable when all the replicas die. If you are unlucky enough to have this occur, it is important to consider what will happen. There are two behaviors that could be
implemented:
<ol>
    <li>Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data).
    <li>Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes back to life as the leader.
</ol>
<p>
This is a simple tradeoff between availability and consistency. If we wait for replicas in the ISR, then we will remain unavailable as long as those replicas are down. If such replicas were destroyed or their data
was lost, then we are permanently down. If, on the other hand, a non-in-sync replica comes back to life and we allow it to become leader, then its log becomes the source of truth even though it is not guaranteed to
have every committed message. By default, Kafka chooses the second strategy and favor choosing a potentially inconsistent replica when all replicas in the ISR are dead. This behavior can be disabled using
configuration property unclean.leader.election.enable, to support use cases where downtime is preferable to inconsistency.
<p>
This dilemma is not specific to Kafka. It exists in any quorum-based scheme. For example in a majority voting scheme, if a majority of servers suffer a permanent failure, then you must either choose to lose 100% of
your data or violate consistency by taking what remains on an existing server as your new source of truth.


<h4><a id="design_ha" href="#design_ha">Availability and Durability Guarantees</a></h4>

When writing to Kafka, producers can choose whether they wait for the message to be acknowledged by 0,1 or all (-1) replicas.
Note that "acknowledgement by all replicas" does not guarantee that the full set of assigned replicas have received the message. By default, when acks=all, acknowledgement happens as soon as all the current in-sync
replicas have received the message. For example, if a topic is configured with only two replicas and one fails (i.e., only one in sync replica remains), then writes that specify acks=all will succeed. However, these
writes could be lost if the remaining replica also fails.

Although this ensures maximum availability of the partition, this behavior may be undesirable to some users who prefer durability over availability. Therefore, we provide two topic-level configurations that can be
used to prefer message durability over availability:
<ol>
    <li> Disable unclean leader election - if all replicas become unavailable, then the partition will remain unavailable until the most recent leader becomes available again. This effectively prefers unavailability
    over the risk of message loss. See the previous section on Unclean Leader Election for clarification. </li>
    <li> Specify a minimum ISR size - the partition will only accept writes if the size of the ISR is above a certain minimum, in order to prevent the loss of messages that were written to just a single replica,
    which subsequently becomes unavailable. This setting only takes effect if the producer uses acks=all and guarantees that the message will be acknowledged by at least this many in-sync replicas.
This setting offers a trade-off between consistency and availability. A higher setting for minimum ISR size guarantees better consistency since the message is guaranteed to be written to more replicas which reduces
the probability that it will be lost. However, it reduces availability since the partition will be unavailable for writes if the number of in-sync replicas drops below the minimum threshold. </li>
</ol>


<h4><a id="design_replicamanagment" href="#design_replicamanagment">Replica Management</a></h4>

The above discussion on replicated logs really covers only a single log, i.e. one topic partition. However a Kafka cluster will manage hundreds or thousands of these partitions. We attempt to balance partitions
within a cluster in a round-robin fashion to avoid clustering all partitions for high-volume topics on a small number of nodes. Likewise we try to balance leadership so that each node is the leader for a proportional
share of its partitions.
<p>
It is also important to optimize the leadership election process as that is the critical window of unavailability. A naive implementation of leader election would end up running an election per partition for all
partitions a node hosted when that node failed. Instead, we elect one of the brokers as the "controller". This controller detects failures at the broker level and is responsible for changing the leader of all
affected partitions in a failed broker. The result is that we are able to batch together many of the required leadership change notifications which makes the election process far cheaper and faster for a large number
of partitions. If the controller fails, one of the surviving brokers will become the new controller.

<h3><a id="compaction" href="#compaction">4.8 Log Compaction</a></h3>

Log compaction ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the last known value for each message key within the log of data for a single topic partition.  It addresses use cases and scenarios such as restoring
state after application crashes or system failure, or reloading caches after application restarts during operational maintenance. Let's dive into these use cases in more detail and then describe how compaction works.
<p>
So far we have described only the simpler approach to data retention where old log data is discarded after a fixed period of time or when the log reaches some predetermined size. This works well for temporal event
data such as logging where each record stands alone. However an important class of data streams are the log of changes to keyed, mutable data (for example, the changes to a database table).
<p>
Let's discuss a concrete example of such a stream. Say we have a topic containing user email addresses; every time a user updates their email address we send a message to this topic using their user id as the
primary key. Now say we send the following messages over some time period for a user with id 123, each message corresponding to a change in email address (messages for other ids are omitted):
<pre class="brush: text;">
    123 => bill@microsoft.com
            .
            .
            .
    123 => bill@gatesfoundation.org
            .
            .
            .
    123 => bill@gmail.com
</pre>
Log compaction gives us a more granular retention mechanism so that we are guaranteed to retain at least the last update for each primary key (e.g. <code>bill@gmail.com</code>). By doing this we guarantee that the
log contains a full snapshot of the final value for every key not just keys that changed recently. This means downstream consumers can restore their own state off this topic without us having to retain a complete
log of all changes.
<p>
Let's start by looking at a few use cases where this is useful, then we'll see how it can be used.
<ol>
<li><i>Database change subscription</i>. It is often necessary to have a data set in multiple data systems, and often one of these systems is a database of some kind (either a RDBMS or perhaps a new-fangled key-value
store). For example you might have a database, a cache, a search cluster, and a Hadoop cluster. Each change to the database will need to be reflected in the cache, the search cluster, and eventually in Hadoop.
In the case that one is only handling the real-time updates you only need recent log. But if you want to be able to reload the cache or restore a failed search node you may need a complete data set.
<li><i>Event sourcing</i>. This is a style of application design which co-locates query processing with application design and uses a log of changes as the primary store for the application.
<li><i>Journaling for high-availability</i>. A process that does local computation can be made fault-tolerant by logging out changes that it makes to its local state so another process can reload these changes and
carry on if it should fail. A concrete example of this is handling counts, aggregations, and other "group by"-like processing in a stream query system. Samza, a real-time stream-processing framework,
<a href="http://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0/container/state-management.html">uses this feature</a> for exactly this purpose.
</ol>
In each of these cases one needs primarily to handle the real-time feed of changes, but occasionally, when a machine crashes or data needs to be re-loaded or re-processed, one needs to do a full load.
Log compaction allows feeding both of these use cases off the same backing topic.

This style of usage of a log is described in more detail in <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">this blog post</a>.
<p>
The general idea is quite simple. If we had infinite log retention, and we logged each change in the above cases, then we would have captured the state of the system at each time from when it first began.
Using this complete log, we could restore to any point in time by replaying the first N records in the log. This hypothetical complete log is not very practical for systems that update a single record many times
as the log will grow without bound even for a stable dataset. The simple log retention mechanism which throws away old updates will bound space but the log is no longer a way to restore the current state&mdash;now
restoring from the beginning of the log no longer recreates the current state as old updates may not be captured at all.
<p>
Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the
same primary key. This way the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key.
<p>
This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics where retention is enforced by compaction.
<p>
This functionality is inspired by one of LinkedIn's oldest and most successful pieces of infrastructure&mdash;a database changelog caching service called <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/databus">Databus</a>.
Unlike most log-structured storage systems Kafka is built for subscription and organizes data for fast linear reads and writes. Unlike Databus, Kafka acts as a source-of-truth store so it is useful even in
situations where the upstream data source would not otherwise be replayable.

<h4><a id="design_compactionbasics" href="#design_compactionbasics">Log Compaction Basics</a></h4>

Here is a high-level picture that shows the logical structure of a Kafka log with the offset for each message.
<p>
<img class="centered" src="/{{version}}/images/log_cleaner_anatomy.png">
<p>
The head of the log is identical to a traditional Kafka log. It has dense, sequential offsets and retains all messages. Log compaction adds an option for handling the tail of the log. The picture above shows a log
with a compacted tail. Note that the messages in the tail of the log retain the original offset assigned when they were first written&mdash;that never changes. Note also that all offsets remain valid positions in
the log, even if the message with that offset has been compacted away; in this case this position is indistinguishable from the next highest offset that does appear in the log. For example, in the picture above the
offsets 36, 37, and 38 are all equivalent positions and a read beginning at any of these offsets would return a message set beginning with 38.
<p>
Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null payload will be treated as a delete from the log. This delete marker will cause any prior message with that key to be removed (as would any new
message with that key), but delete markers are special in that they will themselves be cleaned out of the log after a period of time to free up space. The point in time at which deletes are no longer retained is
marked as the "delete retention point" in the above diagram.
<p>
The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log segments. Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting
producers and consumers. The actual process of compacting a log segment looks something like this:
<p>
<img class="centered" src="/{{version}}/images/log_compaction.png">
<p>
<h4><a id="design_compactionguarantees" href="#design_compactionguarantees">What guarantees does log compaction provide?</a></h4>

Log compaction guarantees the following:
<ol>
<li>Any consumer that stays caught-up to within the head of the log will see every message that is written; these messages will have sequential offsets. The topic's <code>min.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to
guarantee the minimum length of time must pass after a message is written before it could be compacted. I.e. it provides a lower bound on how long each message will remain in the (uncompacted) head.
<li>Ordering of messages is always maintained.  Compaction will never re-order messages, just remove some.
<li>The offset for a message never changes.  It is the permanent identifier for a position in the log.
<li>Any consumer progressing from the start of the log will see at least the final state of all records in the order they were written.  Additionally, all delete markers for deleted records will be seen, provided
the consumer reaches the head of the log in a time period less than the topic's <code>delete.retention.ms</code> setting (the default is 24 hours).  In other words: since the removal of delete markers happens
concurrently with reads, it is possible for a consumer to miss delete markers if it lags by more than <code>delete.retention.ms</code>.
</ol>

<h4><a id="design_compactiondetails" href="#design_compactiondetails">Log Compaction Details</a></h4>

Log compaction is handled by the log cleaner, a pool of background threads that recopy log segment files, removing records whose key appears in the head of the log. Each compactor thread works as follows:
<ol>
<li>It chooses the log that has the highest ratio of log head to log tail
<li>It creates a succinct summary of the last offset for each key in the head of the log
<li>It recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a later occurrence in the log. New, clean segments are swapped into the log immediately so the additional disk space required is just one
additional log segment (not a fully copy of the log).
<li>The summary of the log head is essentially just a space-compact hash table. It uses exactly 24 bytes per entry. As a result with 8GB of cleaner buffer one cleaner iteration can clean around 366GB of log head
(assuming 1k messages).
</ol>
<p>
<h4><a id="design_compactionconfig" href="#design_compactionconfig">Configuring The Log Cleaner</a></h4>

The log cleaner is enabled by default. This will start the pool of cleaner threads.
To enable log cleaning on a particular topic you can add the log-specific property
<pre class="brush: text;">  log.cleanup.policy=compact</pre>
This can be done either at topic creation time or using the alter topic command.
<p>
The log cleaner can be configured to retain a minimum amount of the uncompacted "head" of the log. This is enabled by setting the compaction time lag.
<pre class="brush: text;">  log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms</pre>

This can be used to prevent messages newer than a minimum message age from being subject to compaction. If not set, all log segments are eligible for compaction except for the last segment, i.e. the one currently
being written to. The active segment will not be compacted even if all of its messages are older than the minimum compaction time lag.
</p>
<p>
Further cleaner configurations are described <a href="/documentation.html#brokerconfigs">here</a>.

<h3><a id="design_quotas" href="#design_quotas">4.9 Quotas</a></h3>
<p>
Kafka cluster has the ability to enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources used by clients. Two types
of client quotas can be enforced by Kafka brokers for each group of clients sharing a quota:
<ol>
  <li>Network bandwidth quotas define byte-rate thresholds (since 0.9)</li>
  <li>Request rate quotas define CPU utilization thresholds as a percentage of network and I/O threads (since 0.11)</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h4><a id="design_quotasnecessary" href="#design_quotasnecessary">Why are quotas necessary?</a></h4>
<p>
It is possible for producers and consumers to produce/consume very high volumes of data or generate requests at a very high
rate and thus monopolize broker resources, cause network saturation and generally DOS other clients and the brokers themselves.
Having quotas protects against these issues and is all the more important in large multi-tenant clusters where a small set of badly behaved clients can degrade user experience for the well behaved ones.
In fact, when running Kafka as a service this even makes it possible to enforce API limits according to an agreed upon contract.
</p>
<h4><a id="design_quotasgroups" href="#design_quotasgroups">Client groups</a></h4>
    The identity of Kafka clients is the user principal which represents an authenticated user in a secure cluster. In a cluster that supports unauthenticated clients, user principal is a grouping of unauthenticated
    users
    chosen by the broker using a configurable <code>PrincipalBuilder</code>. Client-id is a logical grouping of clients with a meaningful name chosen by the client application. The tuple (user, client-id) defines
    a secure logical group of clients that share both user principal and client-id.
<p>
    Quotas can be applied to (user, client-id), user or client-id groups. For a given connection, the most specific quota matching the connection is applied. All connections of a quota group share the quota configured for the group.
    For example, if (user="test-user", client-id="test-client") has a produce quota of 10MB/sec, this is shared across all producer instances of user "test-user" with the client-id "test-client".
</p>
<h4><a id="design_quotasconfig" href="#design_quotasconfig">Quota Configuration</a></h4>
<p>
    Quota configuration may be defined for (user, client-id), user and client-id groups. It is possible to override the default quota at any of the quota levels that needs a higher (or even lower) quota.
    The mechanism is similar to the per-topic log config overrides.
    User and (user, client-id) quota overrides are written to ZooKeeper under <i><b>/config/users</b></i> and client-id quota overrides are written under <i><b>/config/clients</b></i>.
    These overrides are read by all brokers and are effective immediately. This lets us change quotas without having to do a rolling restart of the entire cluster. See <a href="#quotas">here</a> for details.
    Default quotas for each group may also be updated dynamically using the same mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    The order of precedence for quota configuration is:
    <ol>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
        <li>/config/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
    </ol>
 <p>
    As a result of these factors using the filesystem and relying on pagecache is superior to maintaining an in-memory cache or other structure&mdash;we at least double the available cache by having automatic access
    to all free memory, and likely double again by storing a compact byte structure rather than individual objects. Doing so will result in a cache of up to 28-30GB on a 32GB machine without GC penalties.
    Furthermore, this cache will stay warm even if the service is restarted, whereas the in-process cache will need to be rebuilt in memory (which for a 10GB cache may take 10 minutes) or else it will need to start
    with a completely cold cache (which likely means terrible initial performance). This also greatly simplifies the code as all logic for maintaining coherency between the cache and filesystem is now in the OS,
    which tends to do so more efficiently and more correctly than one-off in-process attempts. If your disk usage favors linear reads then read-ahead is effectively pre-populating this cache with useful data on each
    disk read.
    <p>
    This suggests a design which is very simple: rather than maintain as much as possible in-memory and flush it all out to the filesystem in a panic when we run out of space, we invert that. All data is immediately
    written to a persistent log on the filesystem without necessarily flushing to disk. In effect this just means that it is transferred into the kernel's pagecache.
    <p>
    This style of pagecache-centric design is described in an <a href="http://varnish-cache.org/wiki/ArchitectNotes">article</a> on the design of Varnish here (along with a healthy dose of arrogance).

    <h4><a id="design_constanttime" href="#design_constanttime">Constant Time Suffices</a></h4>
    <p>
    The persistent data structure used in messaging systems are often a per-consumer queue with an associated BTree or other general-purpose random access data structures to maintain metadata about messages.
    BTrees are the most versatile data structure available, and make it possible to support a wide variety of transactional and non-transactional semantics in the messaging system.
    They do come with a fairly high cost, though: Btree operations are O(log N). Normally O(log N) is considered essentially equivalent to constant time, but this is not true for disk operations.
    Disk seeks come at 10 ms a pop, and each disk can do only one seek at a time so parallelism is limited. Hence even a handful of disk seeks leads to very high overhead.
    Since storage systems mix very fast cached operations with very slow physical disk operations, the observed performance of tree structures is often superlinear as data increases with fixed cache--i.e. doubling
    your data makes things much worse than twice as slow.
    <p>
    Intuitively a persistent queue could be built on simple reads and appends to files as is commonly the case with logging solutions. This structure has the advantage that all operations are O(1) and reads do not
    block writes or each other. This has obvious performance advantages since the performance is completely decoupled from the data size&mdash;one server can now take full advantage of a number of cheap,
    low-rotational speed 1+TB SATA drives. Though they have poor seek performance, these drives have acceptable performance for large reads and writes and come at 1/3 the price and 3x the capacity.
    <p>
    Having access to virtually unlimited disk space without any performance penalty means that we can provide some features not usually found in a messaging system. For example, in Kafka, instead of attempting to
    delete messages as soon as they are consumed, we can retain messages for a relatively long period (say a week). This leads to a great deal of flexibility for consumers, as we will describe.

    <h3><a id="maximizingefficiency" href="#maximizingefficiency">4.3 Efficiency </a></h3>
    <p>
    We have put significant effort into efficiency. One of our primary use cases is handling web activity data, which is very high volume: each page view may generate dozens of writes. Furthermore, we assume each
    message published is read by at least one consumer (often many), hence we strive to make consumption as cheap as possible.
    我们在性能上已经做了很大的努力. 我们主要的使用场景是处理网络活动数据, 这个数据量非常大, 因为每个页面都有可能大量的写入. 此外我们假设每个发布 message 至少被一个consumer (通常很多个consumer) 消费, 因此我们努力让消费尽可能付出少的
    代价.
    <p>
    We have also found, from experience building and running a number of similar systems, that efficiency is a key to effective multi-tenant operations. If the downstream infrastructure service can easily become a
    bottleneck due to a small bump in usage by the application, such small changes will often create problems. By being very fast we help ensure that the application will tip-over under load before the infrastructure.
    This is particularly important when trying to run a centralized service that supports dozens or hundreds of applications on a centralized cluster as changes in usage patterns are a near-daily occurrence.
    我们还发现, 从构建和运行许多相似系统的经验上来看, 性能是多租户运营的关键. 如果下游的基础设施服务很轻易被应用层冲击形成瓶颈, 那么一些小的改变也会造成问题. 通过非常快的(缓存)技术, 我们能确保应用层冲击基础设施之前, 将负载稳定下来.
    当尝试去运行支持集中式集群上成百上千个应用程序的集中式服务时, 这一点很重要, 因为应用层使用方式几乎每天都会发生变化.
    <p>
    We discussed disk efficiency in the previous section. Once poor disk access patterns have been eliminated, there are two common causes of inefficiency in this type of system: too many small I/O operations, and
    excessive byte copying.
    我们在上一节讨论了磁盘性能. 一旦消除了磁盘访问模式不佳的情况, 还有可能导致系统效率低下的两个常见原因是: 太多的小 I/O 操作, 过多的字节复制. 
    <p>
    The small I/O problem happens both between the client and the server and in the server's own persistent operations.
    客户端和服务端之间以及服务端自身的持久化操作都会导致小的 I/O 问题. 
    <p>
    To avoid this, our protocol is built around a "message set" abstraction that naturally groups messages together. This allows network requests to group messages together and amortize the overhead of the network
    roundtrip rather than sending a single message at a time. The server in turn appends chunks of messages to its log in one go, and the consumer fetches large linear chunks at a time.
    为了避免这种情况, 我们的协议是建立在一个 "消息块" 抽象的基础上, 合理将消息分组在一起, 这使得网络请求将获得分组信息并分摊网络的开销往返而不是一次发送一条消息. 服务端依次将消息块一次加载到它的日志中, consumer 一次获取大的线性
    的消息块. 
    <p>
    This simple optimization produces orders of magnitude speed up. Batching leads to larger network packets, larger sequential disk operations, contiguous memory blocks, and so on, all of which allows Kafka to turn
    a bursty stream of random message writes into linear writes that flow to the consumers.
    这个简单的优化将速度提升了数量级. 批处理允许更大的网络数据包, 更大的顺序读写磁盘操作, 连续的内存块等等, 所有这些都使 KafKa 将随机流消息顺序写入到磁盘, 再由 consumers 进行消费 .
    <p>
    The other inefficiency is in byte copying. At low message rates this is not an issue, but under load the impact is significant. To avoid this we employ a standardized binary message format that is shared by the
    producer, the broker, and the consumer (so data chunks can be transferred without modification between them).
    另一个低效率的操作是字节复制, 在消息量少时, 这不是问题. 但是在高负载情况下, 影响还是挺大的. 为了避免这种情况, 我们使用 producer , broker , 和 consumer 都能用的标准化的二进制消息格式, 这样数据不用修改就能在他们之间传递. 
    <p>
    The message log maintained by the broker is itself just a directory of files, each populated by a sequence of message sets that have been written to disk in the same format used by the producer and consumer.
    Maintaining this common format allows optimization of the most important operation: network transfer of persistent log chunks. Modern unix operating systems offer a highly optimized code path for transferring data
    out of pagecache to a socket; in Linux this is done with the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>. 
    broker 维护的消息日志本身就是一个文件目录, 每个文件都是序列化的消息块, 以 producer 和 consumer 所使用格式写入到磁盘. 保持这种通用格式能得到最重要优化方式: 持久日志块的网络传输. 
    现代的 unix 操作系统提供了一个高度优化的编码路径,用于将数据从页面缓存转移到套接字; Linux 是这样做的 <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sendfile.2.html">sendfile system call</a>.
    <p>
    To understand the impact of sendfile, it is important to understand the common data path for transfer of data from file to socket:
    为了理解 sendfile 的意义, 了解数据从文件传输到套接字的常见数据路径非常重要: 
    <ol>
        <li>The operating system reads data from the disk into pagecache in kernel space 操作系统从磁盘读取数据到内核空间的 pagecache </li>
        <li>The application reads the data from kernel space into a user-space buffer  应用程序读取内核空间的数据到用户空间的缓冲区</li>
        <li>The application writes the data back into kernel space into a socket buffer  应用程序将数据(用户空间的缓冲区)写回内核空间到套接字缓冲区(内核空间)</li>
        <li>The operating system copies the data from the socket buffer to the NIC buffer where it is sent over the network 操作系统将数据从套接字缓冲区(内核空间)复制到通过网络发送的 NIC 缓冲区 </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    This is clearly inefficient, there are four copies and two system calls. Using sendfile, this re-copying is avoided by allowing the OS to send the data from pagecache to the network directly. So in this optimized
    path, only the final copy to the NIC buffer is needed.
    这显然是低效的, 有四个副本和两次系统调用. 使用 sendfile , 通过允许操作系统将数据从 pagecache 直接发送到网络, 这样避免重新复制数据. 所以在这个优化路径,只需要将最终数据拷贝到 NIC 缓冲区.
    <p>
    We expect a common use case to be multiple consumers on a topic. Using the zero-copy optimization above, data is copied into pagecache exactly once and reused on each consumption instead of being stored in memory
    and copied out to user-space every time it is read. This allows messages to be consumed at a rate that approaches the limit of the network connection. 
    我们期望一个 topic 有多个 consumer 是普遍的使用场景. 使用上述的零复制优化, 数据在使用时只会被复制到 pagecache 中一次, 而不是每次拷贝到用户空间内存,再进行读取. 这使得消息能够以网络连接速度的上限进行消费. 
    <p>
    This combination of pagecache and sendfile means that on a Kafka cluster where the consumers are mostly caught up you will see no read activity on the disks whatsoever as they will be serving data entirely from cache.
    pagecache 和 sendfile 的组合使用意味着,在一个kafka集群中, 大多数 consumer 消费时, 您将看不到磁盘上的读取活动, 因为它们将完全从缓存中提供数据.

    <h4><a id="design_compression" href="#design_compression">End-to-end Batch Compression 端到端的批量压缩</a></h4>
    <p>
    In some cases the bottleneck is actually not CPU or disk but network bandwidth. This is particularly true for a data pipeline that needs to send messages between data centers over a wide-area network. Of course,
    the user can always compress its messages one at a time without any support needed from Kafka, but this can lead to very poor compression ratios as much of the redundancy is due to repetition between messages of
    the same type (e.g. field names in JSON or user agents in web logs or common string values). Efficient compression requires compressing multiple messages together rather than compressing each message individually.
    在某些情况下, 数据传输的瓶颈不是 CPU 或 磁盘, 而是网络带宽. 对于需要通过广域网在数据中心之间发送消息的数据方式尤其如此. 当然, 用户可以在不需要 Kakfa 支持下一个一个的压缩消息. 但是这样会造成非常差的压缩比, 和消息重复类型的冗余, 比如
    JSON 中的字段名称或者是或 Web 日志中的用户代理或公共字符串值. 高性能的压缩是一次压缩多个消息, 而不是压缩单个消息.
    <p>
    Kafka supports this with an efficient batching format. A batch of messages can be clumped together compressed and sent to the server in this form. This batch of messages will be written in compressed form and will
    remain compressed in the log and will only be decompressed by the consumer.
    Kafka 以高效的批处理格式支持一批消息可以压缩在一起发送到服务器. 这批消息将以压缩格式写入, 并且在日志中保持压缩, 只会在 consumer 消费时解压缩.
    <p>
    Kafka supports GZIP, Snappy and LZ4 compression protocols. More details on compression can be found <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compression">here</a>.

    <h3><a id="theproducer" href="#theproducer">4.4 The Producer</a></h3>

    <h4><a id="design_loadbalancing" href="#design_loadbalancing">Load balancing</a></h4>
    <p>
    The producer sends data directly to the broker that is the leader for the partition without any intervening routing tier. To help the producer do this all Kafka nodes can answer a request for metadata about which
    servers are alive and where the leaders for the partitions of a topic are at any given time to allow the producer to appropriately direct its requests.
    <p>
    The client controls which partition it publishes messages to. This can be done at random, implementing a kind of random load balancing, or it can be done by some semantic partitioning function. We expose the interface
    for semantic partitioning by allowing the user to specify a key to partition by and using this to hash to a partition (there is also an option to override the partition function if need be). For example if the key
    chosen was a user id then all data for a given user would be sent to the same partition. This in turn will allow consumers to make locality assumptions about their consumption. This style of partitioning is explicitly
    designed to allow locality-sensitive processing in consumers.

    <h4><a id="design_asyncsend" href="#design_asyncsend">Asynchronous send</a></h4>
    <p>
    Batching is one of the big drivers of efficiency, and to enable batching the Kafka producer will attempt to accumulate data in memory and to send out larger batches in a single request. The batching can be configured
    to accumulate no more than a fixed number of messages and to wait no longer than some fixed latency bound (say 64k or 10 ms). This allows the accumulation of more bytes to send, and few larger I/O operations on the
    servers. This buffering is configurable and gives a mechanism to trade off a small amount of additional latency for better throughput.
    <p>
    Details on <a href="#producerconfigs">configuration</a> and the <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/082/javadoc/index.html?org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/KafkaProducer.html">api</a> for the producer can be found
    elsewhere in the documentation.

    <h3><a id="theconsumer" href="#theconsumer">4.5 The Consumer</a></h3>

    The Kafka consumer works by issuing "fetch" requests to the brokers leading the partitions it wants to consume. The consumer specifies its offset in the log with each request and receives back a chunk of log
    beginning from that position. The consumer thus has significant control over this position and can rewind it to re-consume data if need be.

    <h4><a id="design_pull" href="#design_pull">Push vs. pull</a></h4>
    <p>
    An initial question we considered is whether consumers should pull data from brokers or brokers should push data to the consumer. In this respect Kafka follows a more traditional design, shared by most messaging
    systems, where data is pushed to the broker from the producer and pulled from the broker by the consumer. Some logging-centric systems, such as <a href="http://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a> and
    <a href="http://flume.apache.org/">Apache Flume</a>, follow a very different push-based path where data is pushed downstream. There are pros and cons to both approaches. However, a push-based system has difficulty
    dealing with diverse consumers as the broker controls the rate at which data is transferred. The goal is generally for the consumer to be able to consume at the maximum possible rate; unfortunately, in a push
    system this means the consumer tends to be overwhelmed when its rate of consumption falls below the rate of production (a denial of service attack, in essence). A pull-based system has the nicer property that
    the consumer simply falls behind and catches up when it can. This can be mitigated with some kind of backoff protocol by which the consumer can indicate it is overwhelmed, but getting the rate of transfer to
    fully utilize (but never over-utilize) the consumer is trickier than it seems. Previous attempts at building systems in this fashion led us to go with a more traditional pull model.
    <p>
    Another advantage of a pull-based system is that it lends itself to aggressive batching of data sent to the consumer. A push-based system must choose to either send a request immediately or accumulate more data
    and then send it later without knowledge of whether the downstream consumer will be able to immediately process it. If tuned for low latency, this will result in sending a single message at a time only for the
    transfer to end up being buffered anyway, which is wasteful. A pull-based design fixes this as the consumer always pulls all available messages after its current position in the log (or up to some configurable max
    size). So one gets optimal batching without introducing unnecessary latency.
    <p>
    The deficiency of a naive pull-based system is that if the broker has no data the consumer may end up polling in a tight loop, effectively busy-waiting for data to arrive. To avoid this we have parameters in our
    pull request that allow the consumer request to block in a "long poll" waiting until data arrives (and optionally waiting until a given number of bytes is available to ensure large transfer sizes).
    <p>
    You could imagine other possible designs which would be only pull, end-to-end. The producer would locally write to a local log, and brokers would pull from that with consumers pulling from them. A similar type of
    "store-and-forward" producer is often proposed. This is intriguing but we felt not very suitable for our target use cases which have thousands of producers. Our experience running persistent data systems at
    scale led us to feel that involving thousands of disks in the system across many applications would not actually make things more reliable and would be a nightmare to operate. And in practice we have found that we
    can run a pipeline with strong SLAs at large scale without a need for producer persistence.

    <h4><a id="design_consumerposition" href="#design_consumerposition">Consumer Position</a></h4>
    Keeping track of <i>what</i> has been consumed is, surprisingly, one of the key performance points of a messaging system.
    <p>
    Most messaging systems keep metadata about what messages have been consumed on the broker. That is, as a message is handed out to a consumer, the broker either records that fact locally immediately or it may wait
    for acknowledgement from the consumer. This is a fairly intuitive choice, and indeed for a single machine server it is not clear where else this state could go. Since the data structures used for storage in many
    messaging systems scale poorly, this is also a pragmatic choice--since the broker knows what is consumed it can immediately delete it, keeping the data size small.
    <p>
    What is perhaps not obvious is that getting the broker and consumer to come into agreement about what has been consumed is not a trivial problem. If the broker records a message as <b>consumed</b> immediately every
    time it is handed out over the network, then if the consumer fails to process the message (say because it crashes or the request times out or whatever) that message will be lost. To solve this problem, many messaging
    systems add an acknowledgement feature which means that messages are only marked as <b>sent</b> not <b>consumed</b> when they are sent; the broker waits for a specific acknowledgement from the consumer to record the
    message as <b>consumed</b>. This strategy fixes the problem of losing messages, but creates new problems. First of all, if the consumer processes the message but fails before it can send an acknowledgement then the
    message will be consumed twice. The second problem is around performance, now the broker must keep multiple states about every single message (first to lock it so it is not given out a second time, and then to mark
    it as permanently consumed so that it can be removed). Tricky problems must be dealt with, like what to do with messages that are sent but never acknowledged.
    <p>
    Kafka handles this differently. Our topic is divided into a set of totally ordered partitions, each of which is consumed by exactly one consumer within each subscribing consumer group at any given time. This means
    that the position of a consumer in each partition is just a single integer, the offset of the next message to consume. This makes the state about what has been consumed very small, just one number for each partition.
    This state can be periodically checkpointed. This makes the equivalent of message acknowledgements very cheap.
    <p>
    There is a side benefit of this decision. A consumer can deliberately <i>rewind</i> back to an old offset and re-consume data. This violates the common contract of a queue, but turns out to be an essential feature
    for many consumers. For example, if the consumer code has a bug and is discovered after some messages are consumed, the consumer can re-consume those messages once the bug is fixed.

    <h4><a id="design_offlineload" href="#design_offlineload">Offline Data Load</a></h4>

    Scalable persistence allows for the possibility of consumers that only periodically consume such as batch data loads that periodically bulk-load data into an offline system such as Hadoop or a relational data
    warehouse.
    <p>
    In the case of Hadoop we parallelize the data load by splitting the load over individual map tasks, one for each node/topic/partition combination, allowing full parallelism in the loading. Hadoop provides the task
    management, and tasks which fail can restart without danger of duplicate data&mdash;they simply restart from their original position.

    <h3><a id="semantics" href="#semantics">4.6 Message Delivery Semantics</a></h3>
    <p>
    Now that we understand a little about how producers and consumers work, let's discuss the semantic guarantees Kafka provides between producer and consumer. Clearly there are multiple possible message delivery
    guarantees that could be provided:
    <ul>
    <li>
        <i>At most once</i>&mdash;Messages may be lost but are never redelivered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>At least once</i>&mdash;Messages are never lost but may be redelivered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Exactly once</i>&mdash;this is what people actually want, each message is delivered once and only once.
    </li>
    </ul>

    It's worth noting that this breaks down into two problems: the durability guarantees for publishing a message and the guarantees when consuming a message.
    <p>
    Many systems claim to provide "exactly once" delivery semantics, but it is important to read the fine print, most of these claims are misleading (i.e. they don't translate to the case where consumers or producers
    can fail, cases where there are multiple consumer processes, or cases where data written to disk can be lost).
    <p>
    Kafka's semantics are straight-forward. When publishing a message we have a notion of the message being "committed" to the log. Once a published message is committed it will not be lost as long as one broker that
    replicates the partition to which this message was written remains "alive". The definition of committed message, alive partition as well as a description of which types of failures we attempt to handle will be 
    described in more detail in the next section. For now let's assume a perfect, lossless broker and try to understand the guarantees to the producer and consumer. If a producer attempts to publish a message and 
    experiences a network error it cannot be sure if this error happened before or after the message was committed. This is similar to the semantics of inserting into a database table with an autogenerated key.
    <p>
    Prior to 0.11.0.0, if a producer failed to receive a response indicating that a message was committed, it had little choice but to resend the message. This provides at-least-once delivery semantics since the
    message may be written to the log again during resending if the original request had in fact succeeded. Since 0.11.0.0, the Kafka producer also supports an idempotent delivery option which guarantees that resending
    will not result in duplicate entries in the log. To achieve this, the broker assigns each producer an ID and deduplicates messages using a sequence number that is sent by the producer along with every message.
    Also beginning with 0.11.0.0, the producer supports the ability to send messages to multiple topic partitions using transaction-like semantics: i.e. either all messages are successfully written or none of them are.
    The main use case for this is exactly-once processing between Kafka topics (described below).
    <p>
    Not all use cases require such strong guarantees. For uses which are latency sensitive we allow the producer to specify the durability level it desires. If the producer specifies that it wants to wait on the message
    being committed this can take on the order of 10 ms. However the producer can also specify that it wants to perform the send completely asynchronously or that it wants to wait only until the leader (but not
    necessarily the followers) have the message.
    <p>
    Now let's describe the semantics from the point-of-view of the consumer. All replicas have the exact same log with the same offsets. The consumer controls its position in this log. If the consumer never crashed it
    could just store this position in memory, but if the consumer fails and we want this topic partition to be taken over by another process the new process will need to choose an appropriate position from which to start
    processing. Let's say the consumer reads some messages -- it has several options for processing the messages and updating its position.
    <ol>
    <li>It can read the messages, then save its position in the log, and finally process the messages. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after saving its position but before saving
    the output of its message processing. In this case the process that took over processing would start at the saved position even though a few messages prior to that position had not been processed. This corresponds
    to "at-most-once" semantics as in the case of a consumer failure messages may not be processed.
    <li>It can read the messages, process the messages, and finally save its position. In this case there is a possibility that the consumer process crashes after processing messages but before saving its position.
    In this case when the new process takes over the first few messages it receives will already have been processed. This corresponds to the "at-least-once" semantics in the case of consumer failure. In many cases
    messages have a primary key and so the updates are idempotent (receiving the same message twice just overwrites a record with another copy of itself).
    </ol>
    <p>
    So what about exactly once semantics (i.e. the thing you actually want)? When consuming from a Kafka topic and producing to another topic (as in a <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>
    application), we can leverage the new transactional producer capabilities in 0.11.0.0 that were mentioned above. The consumer's position is stored as a message in a topic, so we can write the offset to Kafka in the
    same transaction as the output topics receiving the processed data. If the transaction is aborted, the consumer's position will revert to its old value and the produced data on the output topics will not be visible
    to other consumers, depending on their "isolation level." In the default "read_uncommitted" isolation level, all messages are visible to consumers even if they were part of an aborted transaction,
    but in "read_committed," the consumer will only return messages from transactions which were committed (and any messages which were not part of a transaction).
    <p>
    When writing to an external system, the limitation is in the need to coordinate the consumer's position with what is actually stored as output. The classic way of achieving this would be to introduce a two-phase
    commit between the storage of the consumer position and the storage of the consumers output. But this can be handled more simply and generally by letting the consumer store its offset in the same place as
    its output. This is better because many of the output systems a consumer might want to write to will not support a two-phase commit. As an example of this, consider a
    <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a> connector which populates data in HDFS along with the offsets of the data it reads so that it is guaranteed that either data and
    offsets are both updated or neither is. We follow similar patterns for many other data systems which require these stronger semantics and for which the messages do not have a primary key to allow for deduplication.
    <p>
    So effectively Kafka supports exactly-once delivery in <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams">Kafka Streams</a>, and the transactional producer/consumer can be used generally to provide
    exactly-once delivery when transfering and processing data between Kafka topics. Exactly-once delivery for other destination systems generally requires cooperation with such systems, but Kafka provides the
    offset which makes implementing this feasible (see also <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect">Kafka Connect</a>). Otherwise, Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery by default, and allows
    the user to implement at-most-once delivery by disabling retries on the producer and committing offsets in the consumer prior to processing a batch of messages.

    <h3><a id="replication" href="#replication">4.7 Replication</a></h3>
    <p>
    Kafka replicates the log for each topic's partitions across a configurable number of servers (you can set this replication factor on a topic-by-topic basis). This allows automatic failover to these replicas when a
    server in the cluster fails so messages remain available in the presence of failures.
    Kafka 允许 topic 的分区拥有若干备份, 您可以为每个topic 配置备份的数量. 当集群中的节点出现故障时, 能自动进行故障转移, 数据依然是可用的. 
    <p>
    Other messaging systems provide some replication-related features, but, in our (totally biased) opinion, this appears to be a tacked-on thing, not heavily used, and with large downsides: slaves are inactive,
    throughput is heavily impacted, it requires fiddly manual configuration, etc. Kafka is meant to be used with replication by default&mdash;in fact we implement un-replicated topics as replicated topics where the
    replication factor is one.
    其他的消息系统也提供了备份相关的特性, 但是在我们(带有偏见)看来, 他们的备份功能不常用, 而且有很大缺点: slaves 处于非活动状态, 会让吞吐量受到严重影响, 并且还要手动配置. Kafka 默认使用备份机制, 事实上, 我们将没有设置备份数的 topic 实现为备份数为
    1 的 topic .
    <p>
    The unit of replication is the topic partition. Under non-failure conditions, each partition in Kafka has a single leader and zero or more followers. The total number of replicas including the leader constitute the
    replication factor. All reads and writes go to the leader of the partition. Typically, there are many more partitions than brokers and the leaders are evenly distributed among brokers. The logs on the followers are
    identical to the leader's log&mdash;all have the same offsets and messages in the same order (though, of course, at any given time the leader may have a few as-yet unreplicated messages at the end of its log).
    创建备份的单位是 topic 的分区, 正常情况下, 每个分区都有一个 leader 和零或多个 followers . 总的备份数是包含 leader 备份数的总和. 所有的读写操作都由 leader 处理, 一般分区的数量都比 broker 的数量多的多, 各分区的 leader 均匀的分布在 
    brokers 中. 所有的 followers 都复制 leader 的日志, 日志中的消息和偏移量都和 leader 中的一致. 当然, 在任何给定时间, leader 的日志末尾时可能有几个消息尚未被备份完成. 
    <p>
    Followers consume messages from the leader just as a normal Kafka consumer would and apply them to their own log. Having the followers pull from the leader has the nice property of allowing the follower to naturally
    batch together log entries they are applying to their log.
    Followers 就像普通的 consumer 那样从 leader 那里拉取消息并保存在自己的日志文件中. 
    <p>
    As with most distributed systems automatically handling failures requires having a precise definition of what it means for a node to be "alive". For Kafka node liveness has two conditions
    许多分布式的消息系统自动的处理故障的要求, 它们对一个节点是否着 "alive" 有着清晰的定义, Kafka 判断节点是否存活有两种方式
    <ol>
        <li>A node must be able to maintain its session with ZooKeeper (via ZooKeeper's heartbeat mechanism) 节点必须可以维护和 ZooKeeper 的连接, Zookeeper 通过心跳机制检查每个节点的连接.
        <li>If it is a slave it must replicate the writes happening on the leader and not fall "too far" behind 如果节点是个 follower , 它必须能及时的同步 leader 的写操作. 这个时间不能延时太久.
    </ol>
    We refer to nodes satisfying these two conditions as being "in sync" to avoid the vagueness of "alive" or "failed". The leader keeps track of the set of "in sync" nodes. If a follower dies, gets stuck, or falls
    behind, the leader will remove it from the list of in sync replicas. The determination of stuck and lagging replicas is controlled by the replica.lag.time.max.ms configuration.
    我们提到满足这两种情况节点就能称之为同步中 , 区别于 "alive" 或者 "failed". Leader会追踪所有同步中的节点. 一旦一个节点挂掉了, 或是写超时, 或是心跳超时, leader 就会把它移除.
    同步超时和写超时的时间的由 replica.lag.time.max.ms 配置确定
    <p>
    In distributed systems terminology we only attempt to handle a  model of failures where nodes suddenly cease working and then later recover (perhaps without knowing that they have died). Kafka does not
    handle so-called "Byzantine" failures in which nodes produce arbitrary or malicious responses (perhaps due to bugs or foul play).
    在分布式系统中, 我们只尝试处理节点突然挂掉,然后又恢复(不知道自己已经挂掉)的 "fail/recover" 模式. Kafka 没有处理所谓的 "Byzantine" 故障, 即一个节点出现了异常的响应(可能出现错误).
    <p>
    We can now more precisely define that a message is considered committed when all in sync replicas for that partition have applied it to their log.
    Only committed messages are ever given out to the consumer. This means that the consumer need not worry about potentially seeing a message that could be lost if the leader fails. Producers, on the other hand, 
    have the option of either waiting for the message to be committed or not, depending on their preference for tradeoff between latency and durability. This preference is controlled by the acks setting that the 
    producer uses.
    Note that topics have a setting for the "minimum number" of in-sync replicas that is checked when the producer requests acknowledgment that a message
    has been written to the full set of in-sync replicas. If a less stringent acknowledgement is requested by the producer, then the message can be committed, and consumed, 
    even if the number of in-sync replicas is lower than the minimum (e.g. it can be as low as just the leader).
    现在, 我们可以更精确地定义, 只有当消息被所有的备份节点加入到日志中时, 才算是提交, 只有提交的消息才会被 consumer 消费, 这样就不用担心一旦 leader 挂掉了消息会丢失.
    另一方面, Producer 也可以选择是否等待消息被提交的通知, 这取决于延迟时间和持久性之间的选择, 这个是由参数 request.required.acks 决定的.
    请注意, Topic 可以设置所有备份的最小同步数量, producer 请求确认消息是否被写入到所有的备份时, 可以用最小同步数量判断. 如果 producer 对同步的备份数没有严格的要求, 那么消息就会被提交, 消费. 
    即便是同步的备份数量低于最小同步数量(例如仅仅只有 leader 同步了数据) .
    <p>
    The guarantee that Kafka offers is that a committed message will not be lost, as long as there is at least one in sync replica alive, at all times.
    在所有时间里, Kafka 保证只要有一个同步中的节点, 提交的消息就不会丢失.
    <p>
    Kafka will remain available in the presence of node failures after a short fail-over period, but may not remain available in the presence of network partitions.
    在短暂的故障节点切换期后, Kafka 将保持可用状态, 但在网络分裂( network partitions )的情况下可能不能保持可用状态.
    <h4><a id="design_replicatedlog" href="#design_replicatedlog">Replicated Logs: Quorums, ISRs, and State Machines (Oh my!)</a></h4>

    At its heart a Kafka partition is a replicated log. The replicated log is one of the most basic primitives in distributed data systems, and there are many approaches for implementing one. A replicated log can be
    used by other systems as a primitive for implementing other distributed systems in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">state-machine style</a>.
    Kafka的核心是备份日志文件，备份日志文件是分布式数据系统最基础的要素, 有很多中实现方法. 备份日志可以被其他系统用作原型实现分布式系统的 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine_replication">状态机</a> 
    <p>
    A replicated log models the process of coming into consensus on the order of a series of values (generally numbering the log entries 0, 1, 2, ...). There are many ways to implement this, but the simplest and fastest
    is with a leader who chooses the ordering of values provided to it. As long as the leader remains alive, all followers need to only copy the values and ordering the leader chooses.
    备份日志按照一系列值的顺序（通常是对日志条目编号0,1,2, ...）进行建模. 有很多种方式实现这个, 但是最简单最快速的方式是 leader 选择值的顺序并提供给其他 Followers. 只要 leader 存活, 所有的 Followers 只需要向 leader 拷贝值和顺序.
    <p>
    Of course if leaders didn't fail we wouldn't need followers! When the leader does die we need to choose a new leader from among the followers. But followers themselves may fall behind or crash so we must ensure we
    choose an up-to-date follower. The fundamental guarantee a log replication algorithm must provide is that if we tell the client a message is committed, and the leader fails, the new leader we elect must also have
    that message. This yields a tradeoff: if the leader waits for more followers to acknowledge a message before declaring it committed then there will be more potentially electable leaders.
    当然, 如果 leader 永远不会挂掉, 我们就不需要 followers . 但是如果 leader 挂了, 我们就需要从 followers 中选举出一个新的 leader. 但是 followers 自身也有可能挂了, 我们必须确保我们能选择一个数据最新的 followers 成为leader.
    备份算法必须提供的基本保证是: 如果我们告诉客户端一个消息被提交, 即便是 leader 挂了, 新的 leader 也会有这个消息. 这就产生了一种情况: leader 在宣布消息被提交之前需要多个 followers 承认消息被提交,这样才有多个潜在
    的 followers 能成为 leader .
    <p>
    If you choose the number of acknowledgements required and the number of logs that must be compared to elect a leader such that there is guaranteed to be an overlap, then this is called a Quorum.
    从 选择所需的确认数量(写) 和 必须比较的日志数量(读) 来选择一个为主, 并且确保读和写数量上大于总的备份数， 这样的读写机制称为 Quorum
    <p>
    A common approach to this tradeoff is to use a majority vote for both the commit decision and the leader election. This is not what Kafka does, but let's explore it anyway to understand the tradeoffs. Let's say we
    have 2<i>f</i>+1 replicas. If <i>f</i>+1 replicas must receive a message prior to a commit being declared by the leader, and if we elect a new leader by electing the follower with the most complete log from at least
    <i>f</i>+1 replicas, then, with no more than <i>f</i> failures, the leader is guaranteed to have all committed messages. This is because among any <i>f</i>+1 replicas, there must be at least one replica that contains
    all committed messages. That replica's log will be the most complete and therefore will be selected as the new leader. There are many remaining details that each algorithm must handle (such as precisely defined what
    makes a log more complete, ensuring log consistency during leader failure or changing the set of servers in the replica set) but we will ignore these for now.
    这种策略的常见方法是投票决定谁是 leader . Kafka 不是这样做的, 但是我们还是了解一下大多数(即超过一半)投票算法. 我们有2<i>f</i> + 1副本. 如果 <i>f</i>+1个副本都能在 leader 宣布消息提交之前收到消息, 那么我们就有 <i>f</i>+1 个拥有完整日志的 followers , 它们都能
    成为新的 leader . 一旦 leader 挂掉, 新的 leader 也有之前所有提交的消息。这个算法都必须处理许多其他细节(例如精确定义怎样使日志更加完整, 确保在 leader down 掉期间, 保证日志一致性或者副本服务器的副本集的改变), 但是现在我们将忽略这些.
    <p>
    This majority vote approach has a very nice property: the latency is dependent on only the fastest servers. That is, if the replication factor is three, the latency is determined by the faster slave not the slower one.
    这种大多数投票方法有一个非常好的优点: 延迟是取决于最快的服务器. 也就是说, 如果复制因子是3, 则备份完成的等待时间取决于最快的 Follwer .
    <p>
    There are a rich variety of algorithms in this family including ZooKeeper's
    这里有很多分布式算法, 包含 ZooKeeper 的

    The most similar academic publication we are aware of to Kafka's actual implementation is
    我们所知道的与 Kafka 实际执行情况最相似的学术刊物是来自微软的

    <p>
    The downside of majority vote is that it doesn't take many failures to leave you with no electable leaders. To tolerate one failure requires three copies of the data, and to tolerate two failures requires five copies
    of the data. In our experience having only enough redundancy to tolerate a single failure is not enough for a practical system, but doing every write five times, with 5x the disk space requirements and 1/5th the
    throughput, is not very practical for large volume data problems. This is likely why quorum algorithms more commonly appear for shared cluster configuration such as ZooKeeper but are less common for primary data
    storage. For example in HDFS the namenode's high-availability feature is built on a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1">majority-vote-based journal</a>, but this more
    expensive approach is not used for the data itself.
    大多数投票的缺点是, 多数的节点挂掉让你不能选择 leader . 要冗余单点故障需要三份数据, 并且要冗余两个故障需要五份的数据. 根据我们的经验, 在一个系统中, 仅仅靠冗余来避免单点故障是不够的, 但是每写5次, 对磁盘空间需求是5倍, 
    吞吐量下降到 1/5, 这对于处理海量数据问题是不切实际的.  这可能是为什么 quorum 算法更常用于共享集群配置(如 ZooKeeper ), 而不适用于原始数据存储的原因, 例如 HDFS 中 namenode 的高可用是建立在  
    <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/10/quorum-based-journaling-in-cdh4-1">基于投票的元数据</a> , 这种代价高昂的存储方式不适用数据本身.
    <p>
    Kafka takes a slightly different approach to choosing its quorum set. Instead of majority vote, Kafka dynamically maintains a set of in-sync replicas (ISR) that are caught-up to the leader. Only members of this set
    are eligible for election as leader. A write to a Kafka partition is not considered committed until <i>all</i> in-sync replicas have received the write. This ISR set is persisted to ZooKeeper whenever it changes.
    Because of this, any replica in the ISR is eligible to be elected leader. This is an important factor for Kafka's usage model where there are many partitions and ensuring leadership balance is important.
    With this ISR model and <i>f+1</i> replicas, a Kafka topic can tolerate <i>f</i> failures without losing committed messages.
    Kafka 采取了一种稍微不同的方法来选择它的投票集. Kafka 不是用大多数投票选择 leader. Kafka 动态维护了一个同步状态的备份的集合 (a set of in-sync replicas) , 简称ISR,在这个集合中的节点都是和 leader 保持高度一致的, 只有这个集合的成员才
    有资格被选举为 leader, 一条消息必须被这个集合 <i>所有</i> 节点读取并追加到日志中了, 这条消息才能视为提交. 这个 ISR 集合发生变化会在 ZooKeeper 持久化, 正因为如此, 这个集合中的任何一个节点都有资格被选为leader. 这对于 Kafka 使用模型中,
    有很多分区和并确保主从关系是很重要的. 因为 ISR 模型和 <i>f+1</i> 副本, 一个 Kafka topic 冗余 <i>f</i> 个节点故障而不会丢失任何已经提交的消息.
    <p>
    For most use cases we hope to handle, we think this tradeoff is a reasonable one. In practice, to tolerate <i>f</i> failures, both the majority vote and the ISR approach will wait for the same number of replicas to
    acknowledge before committing a message (e.g. to survive one failure a majority quorum needs three replicas and one acknowledgement and the ISR approach requires two replicas and one acknowledgement).
    The ability to commit without the slowest servers is an advantage of the majority vote approach. However, we think it is ameliorated by allowing the client to choose whether they block on the message commit or not,
    and the additional throughput and disk space due to the lower required replication factor is worth it.
    我们认为对于希望处理的大多数场景这种策略是合理的. 在实际中, 为了冗余 <i>f</i> 节点故障, 大多数投票和 ISR 都会在提交消息前确认相同数量的备份被收到(例如在一次故障生存之后, 大多数的 quorum
    需要三个备份节点和一次确认, ISR 只需要两个备份节点和一次确认). , 多数投票方法的一个优点是提交时能避免最慢的服务器. 但是，我们认为通过允许客户端选择是否阻塞消息提交来改善，和所需的备份数较低而产生的额外的吞吐量和磁盘空间是值得的。

    <p>
    Another important design distinction is that Kafka does not require that crashed nodes recover with all their data intact. It is not uncommon for replication algorithms in this space to depend on the existence of
    "stable storage" that cannot be lost in any failure-recovery scenario without potential consistency violations. There are two primary problems with this assumption. First, disk errors are the most common problem we
    observe in real operation of persistent data systems and they often do not leave data intact. Secondly, even if this were not a problem, we do not want to require the use of fsync on every write for our consistency
    guarantees as this can reduce performance by two to three orders of magnitude. Our protocol for allowing a replica to rejoin the ISR ensures that before rejoining, it must fully re-sync again even if it lost unflushed
    data in its crash.
    另一个重要的设计区别是, Kafka 不要求崩溃的节点恢复所有的数据. 在这种空间中的复制算法经常依赖于存在 "稳定存储", 在没有违反潜在的一致性的情况下, 出现任何故障再恢复情况下都不会丢失.
    这个假设有两个主要的问题. 首先，我们在持久性数据系统的实际操作中观察到的最常见的问题是磁盘错误, 并且它们通常不能保证数据的完整性. 其次, 即使磁盘错误不是问题，我们也不希望在每次写入时都要求使用 fsync 来保证一致性, 
    因为这会使性能降低两到三个数量级. 我们的协议能确保备份节点重新加入ISR 之前, 即使它挂时没有新的数据, 它也必须完整再一次同步数据.
    <h4><a id="design_uncleanleader" href="#design_uncleanleader">Unclean leader election: What if they all die?</a></h4>

    Note that Kafka's guarantee with respect to data loss is predicated on at least one replica remaining in sync. If all the nodes replicating a partition die, this guarantee no longer holds.
    请注意, Kafka 对于数据不会丢失的保证, 是基于至少一个节点在保持同步状态, 一旦分区上的所有备份节点都挂了, 就无法保证了.
    <p>
    However a practical system needs to do something reasonable when all the replicas die. If you are unlucky enough to have this occur, it is important to consider what will happen. There are two behaviors that could be
    implemented:
    但是, 实际在运行的系统需要去考虑假设一旦所有的备份都挂了, 怎么去保证数据不会丢失, 这里有两种实现的方法
    <ol>
        <li>Wait for a replica in the ISR to come back to life and choose this replica as the leader (hopefully it still has all its data). 等待一个 ISR 的副本重新恢复正常服务，并选择这个副本作为领 leader (它有极大可能拥有全部数据).
        <li>Choose the first replica (not necessarily in the ISR) that comes back to life as the leader.选择第一个重新恢复正常服务的副本（不一定是 ISR 中的）作为leader
    </ol>
    <p>
    This is a simple tradeoff between availability and consistency. If we wait for replicas in the ISR, then we will remain unavailable as long as those replicas are down. If such replicas were destroyed or their data
    was lost, then we are permanently down. If, on the other hand, a non-in-sync replica comes back to life and we allow it to become leader, then its log becomes the source of truth even though it is not guaranteed to
    have every committed message. By default, Kafka chooses the second strategy and favor choosing a potentially inconsistent replica when all replicas in the ISR are dead. This behavior can be disabled using
    configuration property unclean.leader.election.enable, to support use cases where downtime is preferable to inconsistency.
    这是可用性和一致性之间的简单妥协, 如果我只等待 ISR 的备份节点, 那么只要 ISR 备份节点都挂了, 我们的服务将一直会不可用, 如果它们的数据损坏了或者丢失了, 那就会是长久的宕机. 另一方面, 如果不是 ISR 中的节点恢复服务并且我们也许它成为 leader , 
    那么它的数据就是可信的来源, 即使它不能保证记录了每一个已经提交的消息. kafka 默认选择第二种策略,  当所有的 ISR 副本都挂掉时, 会选择一个可能不同步的备份作为 leader ,可以配置属性 unclean.leader.election.enable 禁用此策略, 那么就会使用第
    一种策略即停机时间优于不同步.
    <p>
    This dilemma is not specific to Kafka. It exists in any quorum-based scheme. For example in a majority voting scheme, if a majority of servers suffer a permanent failure, then you must either choose to lose 100% of
    your data or violate consistency by taking what remains on an existing server as your new source of truth.
    这种困境不只有 Kafka 遇到, 它存在于任何 quorum-based 规则中. 例如, 在大多数投票算法当中, 如果大多数服务器永久性的挂了, 那么您要么选择丢失100%的数据, 要么违背数据的一致性选择一个存活的服务器作为数据可信的来源.
    <h4><a id="design_ha" href="#design_ha">Availability and Durability Guarantees</a></h4>

    When writing to Kafka, producers can choose whether they wait for the message to be acknowledged by 0,1 or all (-1) replicas.
    Note that "acknowledgement by all replicas" does not guarantee that the full set of assigned replicas have received the message. By default, when acks=all, acknowledgement happens as soon as all the current in-sync
    replicas have received the message. For example, if a topic is configured with only two replicas and one fails (i.e., only one in sync replica remains), then writes that specify acks=all will succeed. However, these
    writes could be lost if the remaining replica also fails.
    向 Kafka 写数据时, producers 设置 ack 是否提交完成, 0：不等待broker返回确认消息,1: leader保存成功返回或, -1(all): 所有备份都保存成功返回.请注意. 设置 "ack = all" 并不能保证所有的副本都写入了消息. 默认情况下, 当 acks = all 时, 只要
    ISR 副本同步完成, 就会返回消息已经写入. 例如, 一个 topic 仅仅设置了两个副本, 那么只有一个 ISR 副本, 那么当设置acks = all时返回写入成功时, 剩下了的那个副本数据也可能数据没有写入.  
    Although this ensures maximum availability of the partition, this behavior may be undesirable to some users who prefer durability over availability. Therefore, we provide two topic-level configurations that can be
    used to prefer message durability over availability:
    尽管这确保了分区的最大可用性, 但是对于偏好数据持久性而不是可用性的一些用户, 可能不想用这种策略, 因此, 我们提供了两个topic 配置, 可用于优先配置消息数据持久性:
    <ol>
        <li> Disable unclean leader election - if all replicas become unavailable, then the partition will remain unavailable until the most recent leader becomes available again. This effectively prefers unavailability
        over the risk of message loss. See the previous section on Unclean Leader Election for clarification. 
        禁用 unclean leader 选举机制 - 如果所有的备份节点都挂了, 分区数据就会不可用, 直到最近的 leader 恢复正常. 这种策略优先于数据丢失的风险, 参看上一节的 unclean leader 选举机制.
    </li>
        <li> Specify a minimum ISR size - the partition will only accept writes if the size of the ISR is above a certain minimum, in order to prevent the loss of messages that were written to just a single replica,
        which subsequently becomes unavailable. This setting only takes effect if the producer uses acks=all and guarantees that the message will be acknowledged by at least this many in-sync replicas.
    This setting offers a trade-off between consistency and availability. A higher setting for minimum ISR size guarantees better consistency since the message is guaranteed to be written to more replicas which reduces
    the probability that it will be lost. However, it reduces availability since the partition will be unavailable for writes if the number of in-sync replicas drops below the minimum threshold.
    指定最小的 ISR 集合大小, 只有当 ISR 的大小大于最小值，分区才能接受写入操作, 以防止仅写入单个备份的消息丢失造成消息不可用的情况, 这个设置只有在生产者使用 acks = all 的情况下才会生效，这至少保证消息被 ISR 副本写入. 此设置是一致性和可用性
    之间的折衷,  对于设置更大的最小ISR大小保证了更好的一致性, 因为它保证将消息被写入了更多的备份，减少了消息丢失的可能性. 但是, 这会降低可用性，因为如果 ISR 副本的数量低于最小阈值, 那么分区将无法写入.
    </li>
    </ol>


    <h4><a id="design_replicamanagment" href="#design_replicamanagment">Replica Management</a></h4>
    The above discussion on replicated logs really covers only a single log, i.e. one topic partition. However a Kafka cluster will manage hundreds or thousands of these partitions. We attempt to balance partitions
    within a cluster in a round-robin fashion to avoid clustering all partitions for high-volume topics on a small number of nodes. Likewise we try to balance leadership so that each node is the leader for a proportional
    share of its partitions.
    以上关于备份日志的讨论只涉及单个日志，即一个 topic 分区, 事实上, 一个Kafka集群管理着成百上千个这样的分区.  我们尝试以轮训调度的方式将集群内的分区负载均衡, 避免大量的 topic 所有分区集中在
    少数几个节点上. 同样, 我们也试图让每个节点能按它所占的分区比例份额成为 leader .  
    <p>
    It is also important to optimize the leadership election process as that is the critical window of unavailability. A naive implementation of leader election would end up running an election per partition for all
    partitions a node hosted when that node failed. Instead, we elect one of the brokers as the "controller". This controller detects failures at the broker level and is responsible for changing the leader of all
    affected partitions in a failed broker. The result is that we are able to batch together many of the required leadership change notifications which makes the election process far cheaper and faster for a large number
    of partitions. If the controller fails, one of the surviving brokers will become the new controller.
    优化主从关系的选举过程也是重要的，因为这是数据不可用的关键窗口. 为了当有节点挂了后, 进行主从关系选举时, 能够有节点托管该节点的所有分区运行. 我们选择一个 brokers 作为 "controller". controller 负责检测 brokers 级别故障, 并负责当一个 broker 挂了,
    通知受此 broker 故障影响的分区的 leader. 它可以批量的通知主从关系的变化，这使得选举过程对于拥有大量分区而言要代价低得多并且速度更快.如果 controller 挂了，所有其他存活的 broker 都可能成为新的 controller .      
    <h3><a id="compaction" href="#compaction">4.8 Log Compaction</a></h3>

    Log compaction ensures that Kafka will always retain at least the last known value for each message key within the log of data for a single topic partition.  It addresses use cases and scenarios such as restoring
    state after application crashes or system failure, or reloading caches after application restarts during operational maintenance. Let's dive into these use cases in more detail and then describe how compaction works.
    <p>
    So far we have described only the simpler approach to data retention where old log data is discarded after a fixed period of time or when the log reaches some predetermined size. This works well for temporal event
    data such as logging where each record stands alone. However an important class of data streams are the log of changes to keyed, mutable data (for example, the changes to a database table).
    <p>
    Let's discuss a concrete example of such a stream. Say we have a topic containing user email addresses; every time a user updates their email address we send a message to this topic using their user id as the
    primary key. Now say we send the following messages over some time period for a user with id 123, each message corresponding to a change in email address (messages for other ids are omitted):
    <pre class="brush: text;">
        123 => bill@microsoft.com
                .
                .
                .
        123 => bill@gatesfoundation.org
                .
                .
                .
        123 => bill@gmail.com
    </pre>
    Log compaction gives us a more granular retention mechanism so that we are guaranteed to retain at least the last update for each primary key (e.g. <code>bill@gmail.com</code>). By doing this we guarantee that the
    log contains a full snapshot of the final value for every key not just keys that changed recently. This means downstream consumers can restore their own state off this topic without us having to retain a complete
    log of all changes.
    <p>
    Let's start by looking at a few use cases where this is useful, then we'll see how it can be used.
    <ol>
    <li><i>Database change subscription</i>. It is often necessary to have a data set in multiple data systems, and often one of these systems is a database of some kind (either a RDBMS or perhaps a new-fangled key-value
    store). For example you might have a database, a cache, a search cluster, and a Hadoop cluster. Each change to the database will need to be reflected in the cache, the search cluster, and eventually in Hadoop.
    In the case that one is only handling the real-time updates you only need recent log. But if you want to be able to reload the cache or restore a failed search node you may need a complete data set.
    <li><i>Event sourcing</i>. This is a style of application design which co-locates query processing with application design and uses a log of changes as the primary store for the application.
    <li><i>Journaling for high-availability</i>. A process that does local computation can be made fault-tolerant by logging out changes that it makes to its local state so another process can reload these changes and
    carry on if it should fail. A concrete example of this is handling counts, aggregations, and other "group by"-like processing in a stream query system. Samza, a real-time stream-processing framework,
    <a href="http://samza.apache.org/learn/documentation/0.7.0/container/state-management.html">uses this feature</a> for exactly this purpose.
    </ol>
    In each of these cases one needs primarily to handle the real-time feed of changes, but occasionally, when a machine crashes or data needs to be re-loaded or re-processed, one needs to do a full load.
    Log compaction allows feeding both of these use cases off the same backing topic.

    This style of usage of a log is described in more detail in <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying">this blog post</a>.
    <p>
    The general idea is quite simple. If we had infinite log retention, and we logged each change in the above cases, then we would have captured the state of the system at each time from when it first began.
    Using this complete log, we could restore to any point in time by replaying the first N records in the log. This hypothetical complete log is not very practical for systems that update a single record many times
    as the log will grow without bound even for a stable dataset. The simple log retention mechanism which throws away old updates will bound space but the log is no longer a way to restore the current state&mdash;now
    restoring from the beginning of the log no longer recreates the current state as old updates may not be captured at all.
    <p>
    Log compaction is a mechanism to give finer-grained per-record retention, rather than the coarser-grained time-based retention. The idea is to selectively remove records where we have a more recent update with the
    same primary key. This way the log is guaranteed to have at least the last state for each key.
    <p>
    This retention policy can be set per-topic, so a single cluster can have some topics where retention is enforced by size or time and other topics where retention is enforced by compaction.
    <p>
    This functionality is inspired by one of LinkedIn's oldest and most successful pieces of infrastructure&mdash;a database changelog caching service called <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/databus">Databus</a>.
    Unlike most log-structured storage systems Kafka is built for subscription and organizes data for fast linear reads and writes. Unlike Databus, Kafka acts as a source-of-truth store so it is useful even in
    situations where the upstream data source would not otherwise be replayable.

    The head of the log is identical to a traditional Kafka log. It has dense, sequential offsets and retains all messages. Log compaction adds an option for handling the tail of the log. The picture above shows a log
    with a compacted tail. Note that the messages in the tail of the log retain the original offset assigned when they were first written&mdash;that never changes. Note also that all offsets remain valid positions in
    the log, even if the message with that offset has been compacted away; in this case this position is indistinguishable from the next highest offset that does appear in the log. For example, in the picture above the
    offsets 36, 37, and 38 are all equivalent positions and a read beginning at any of these offsets would return a message set beginning with 38.
    <p>
    Compaction also allows for deletes. A message with a key and a null payload will be treated as a delete from the log. This delete marker will cause any prior message with that key to be removed (as would any new
    message with that key), but delete markers are special in that they will themselves be cleaned out of the log after a period of time to free up space. The point in time at which deletes are no longer retained is
    marked as the "delete retention point" in the above diagram.
    <p>
    The compaction is done in the background by periodically recopying log segments. Cleaning does not block reads and can be throttled to use no more than a configurable amount of I/O throughput to avoid impacting
    producers and consumers. The actual process of compacting a log segment looks something like this:

    <h4><a id="design_compactionguarantees" href="#design_compactionguarantees">What guarantees does log compaction provide?</a></h4>

    Log compaction guarantees the following:
    <ol>
    <li>Any consumer that stays caught-up to within the head of the log will see every message that is written; these messages will have sequential offsets. The topic's <code>min.compaction.lag.ms</code> can be used to
    guarantee the minimum length of time must pass after a message is written before it could be compacted. I.e. it provides a lower bound on how long each message will remain in the (uncompacted) head.
    <li>Ordering of messages is always maintained.  Compaction will never re-order messages, just remove some.
    <li>The offset for a message never changes.  It is the permanent identifier for a position in the log.
    <li>Any consumer progressing from the start of the log will see at least the final state of all records in the order they were written.  Additionally, all delete markers for deleted records will be seen, provided 
    the consumer reaches the head of the log in a time period less than the topic's <code>delete.retention.ms</code> setting (the default is 24 hours).  In other words: since the removal of delete markers happens 
    concurrently with reads, it is possible for a consumer to miss delete markers if it lags by more than <code>delete.retention.ms</code>.
    </ol>

    <h4><a id="design_compactiondetails" href="#design_compactiondetails">Log Compaction Details</a></h4>

    Log compaction is handled by the log cleaner, a pool of background threads that recopy log segment files, removing records whose key appears in the head of the log. Each compactor thread works as follows:
    <ol>
    <li>It chooses the log that has the highest ratio of log head to log tail
    <li>It creates a succinct summary of the last offset for each key in the head of the log
    <li>It recopies the log from beginning to end removing keys which have a later occurrence in the log. New, clean segments are swapped into the log immediately so the additional disk space required is just one
    additional log segment (not a fully copy of the log).
    <li>The summary of the log head is essentially just a space-compact hash table. It uses exactly 24 bytes per entry. As a result with 8GB of cleaner buffer one cleaner iteration can clean around 366GB of log head
    (assuming 1k messages).
    </ol>
    <p>
    <h4><a id="design_compactionconfig" href="#design_compactionconfig">Configuring The Log Cleaner</a></h4>

    The log cleaner is enabled by default. This will start the pool of cleaner threads. 
    To enable log cleaning on a particular topic you can add the log-specific property
    <pre class="brush: text;">  log.cleanup.policy=compact</pre>
    This can be done either at topic creation time or using the alter topic command.
    <p>
    The log cleaner can be configured to retain a minimum amount of the uncompacted "head" of the log. This is enabled by setting the compaction time lag.
    <pre class="brush: text;">  log.cleaner.min.compaction.lag.ms</pre>

    This can be used to prevent messages newer than a minimum message age from being subject to compaction. If not set, all log segments are eligible for compaction except for the last segment, i.e. the one currently
    being written to. The active segment will not be compacted even if all of its messages are older than the minimum compaction time lag.

    <h3><a id="design_quotas" href="#design_quotas">4.9 Quotas</a></h3>
    <p>
    Kafka cluster has the ability to enforce quotas on requests to control the broker resources used by clients. Two types
    of client quotas can be enforced by Kafka brokers for each group of clients sharing a quota:
    <ol>
      <li>Network bandwidth quotas define byte-rate thresholds (since 0.9)</li>
      <li>Request rate quotas define CPU utilization thresholds as a percentage of network and I/O threads (since 0.11)</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h4><a id="design_quotasnecessary" href="#design_quotasnecessary">Why are quotas necessary?</a></h4>
    <p>
    It is possible for producers and consumers to produce/consume very high volumes of data or generate requests at a very high
    rate and thus monopolize broker resources, cause network saturation and generally DOS other clients and the brokers themselves.
    Having quotas protects against these issues and is all the more important in large multi-tenant clusters where a small set of badly behaved clients can degrade user experience for the well behaved ones.
    In fact, when running Kafka as a service this even makes it possible to enforce API limits according to an agreed upon contract.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="design_quotasgroups" href="#design_quotasgroups">Client groups</a></h4>
        The identity of Kafka clients is the user principal which represents an authenticated user in a secure cluster. In a cluster that supports unauthenticated clients, user principal is a grouping of unauthenticated
        users
        chosen by the broker using a configurable <code>PrincipalBuilder</code>. Client-id is a logical grouping of clients with a meaningful name chosen by the client application. The tuple (user, client-id) defines
        a secure logical group of clients that share both user principal and client-id.
    <p>
        Quotas can be applied to (user, client-id), user or client-id groups. For a given connection, the most specific quota matching the connection is applied. All connections of a quota group share the quota configured for the group.
        For example, if (user="test-user", client-id="test-client") has a produce quota of 10MB/sec, this is shared across all producer instances of user "test-user" with the client-id "test-client".
    </p>
    <h4><a id="design_quotasconfig" href="#design_quotasconfig">Quota Configuration</a></h4>
    <p>
        Quota configuration may be defined for (user, client-id), user and client-id groups. It is possible to override the default quota at any of the quota levels that needs a higher (or even lower) quota.
        The mechanism is similar to the per-topic log config overrides.
        User and (user, client-id) quota overrides are written to ZooKeeper under <i><b>/config/users</b></i> and client-id quota overrides are written under <i><b>/config/clients</b></i>.
        These overrides are read by all brokers and are effective immediately. This lets us change quotas without having to do a rolling restart of the entire cluster. See <a href="#quotas">here</a> for details.
        Default quotas for each group may also be updated dynamically using the same mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
        The order of precedence for quota configuration is:
        <ol>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;user&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/users/&lt;default&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/clients/&lt;client-id&gt;</li>
            <li>/config/clients/&lt;default&gt;</li>
        </ol>
    Broker properties (quota.producer.default, quota.consumer.default) can also be used to set defaults of network bandwidth quotas for client-id groups. These properties are being deprecated and will be removed in a later release.
    Default quotas for client-id can be set in Zookeeper similar to the other quota overrides and defaults.
</p>
<h4><a id="design_quotasbandwidth" href="#design_quotasbandwidth">Network Bandwidth Quotas</a></h4>
<p>
    Network bandwidth quotas are defined as the byte rate threshold for each group of clients sharing a quota.
    By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota in bytes/sec as configured by the cluster.
    This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each group of clients can publish/fetch a maximum of X bytes/sec
    per broker before clients are throttled.
</p>
<h4><a id="design_quotascpu" href="#design_quotascpu">Request Rate Quotas</a></h4>
<p>
    Request rate quotas are defined as the percentage of time a client can utilize on request handler I/O
    threads and network threads of each broker within a quota window. A quota of <tt>n%</tt> represents
    <tt>n%</tt> of one thread, so the quota is out of a total capacity of <tt>((num.io.threads + num.network.threads) * 100)%</tt>.
    Each group of clients may use a total percentage of upto <tt>n%</tt> across all I/O and network threads in a quota
    window before being throttled. Since the number of threads allocated for I/O and network threads are typically based
    on the number of cores available on the broker host, request rate quotas represent the total percentage of CPU
    that may be used by each group of clients sharing the quota.
</p>
<h4><a id="design_quotasenforcement" href="#design_quotasenforcement">Enforcement</a></h4>
<p>
    By default, each unique client group receives a fixed quota as configured by the cluster.
    This quota is defined on a per-broker basis. Each client can utilize this quota per broker before it gets throttled. We decided that defining these quotas per broker is much better than
    having a fixed cluster wide bandwidth per client because that would require a mechanism to share client quota usage among all the brokers. This can be harder to get right than the quota implementation itself!
</p>
<p>
    How does a broker react when it detects a quota violation? In our solution, the broker does not return an error rather it attempts to slow down a client exceeding its quota.
    It computes the amount of delay needed to bring a guilty client under its quota and delays the response for that time. This approach keeps the quota violation transparent to clients
    (outside of client-side metrics). This also keeps them from having to implement any special backoff and retry behavior which can get tricky. In fact, bad client behavior (retry without backoff)
    can exacerbate the very problem quotas are trying to solve.
</p>
<p>
Byte-rate and thread utilization are measured over multiple small windows (e.g. 30 windows of 1 second each) in order to detect and correct quota violations quickly. Typically, having large measurement windows
(for e.g. 10 windows of 30 seconds each) leads to large bursts of traffic followed by long delays which is not great in terms of user experience.
