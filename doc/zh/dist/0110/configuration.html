  <h3><a id="topicconfigs" href="#topicconfigs">3.2 Topic-Level Configs</a></h3>

  Configurations pertinent to topics have both a server default as well an optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the server default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time by giving one or more <code>--config</code> options. This example creates a topic named <i>my-topic</i> with a custom max message size and flush rate:
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1
      --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1
  </pre>
  Overrides can also be changed or set later using the alter configs command. This example updates the max message size for <i>my-topic</i>:
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic
      --alter --add-config max.message.bytes=128000
  </pre>

  To check overrides set on the topic you can do
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --describe
  </pre>

  To remove an override you can do
  <pre class="brush: bash;">
  &gt; bin/kafka-configs.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181  --entity-type topics --entity-name my-topic --alter --delete-config max.message.bytes
  </pre>

  The following are the topic-level configurations. The server's default configuration for this property is given under the Server Default Property heading. A given server default config value only applies to a topic if it does not have an explicit topic config override.

If this minimum cannot be met, then the producer will raise an exception (either NotEnoughReplicas or NotEnoughReplicasAfterAppend).<br>When used together, min.insync.replicas and acks allow you to enforce greater durability guarantees. A typical scenario would be to create a topic with a replication factor of 3, set min.insync.replicas to 2, and produce with acks of "all".

This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>.

<td>acks</td><td>The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the  durability of records that are sent. The following settings are allowed:  <ul> <li><code>acks=0</code> If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the <code>retries</code> configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1. <li><code>acks=1</code> This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost. <li><code>acks=all</code> This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. This is equivalent to the acks=-1 setting.</td><td>string</td><td>1</td><td>[all, -1, 0, 1]</td><td>high</td></tr>

If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will block for <code>max.block.ms</code> after which it will throw an exception.<p>This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.</td><td>long</td><td>33554432</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>high</td></tr>

Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).</td><td>string</td><td>none</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>

Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error.

This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. <p>No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size. <p>Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent. <p>A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely).

<td>linger.ms</td><td>The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay&mdash;that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get <code>batch.size</code> worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting <code>linger.ms=5</code>, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absense of load.</td><td>long</td><td>0</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>

  <h3><a id="consumerconfigs" href="#consumerconfigs">3.4 Consumer Configs</a></h3>

  In 0.9.0.0 we introduced the new Java consumer as a replacement for the older Scala-based simple and high-level consumers.
  The configs for both new and old consumers are described below.

  <h4><a id="newconsumerconfigs" href="#newconsumerconfigs">3.4.1 New Consumer Configs</a></h4>
  Below is the configuration for the new consumer:

</tr>
<tr>
<td>bootstrap.servers</td><td>A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).</td><td>list</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>value.deserializer</td><td>Deserializer class for value that implements the <code>Deserializer</code> interface.</td><td>class</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>fetch.min.bytes</td><td>The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate before answering the request. The default setting of 1 byte means that fetch requests are answered as soon as a single byte of data is available or the fetch request times out waiting for data to arrive. Setting this to something greater than 1 will cause the server to wait for larger amounts of data to accumulate which can improve server throughput a bit at the cost of some additional latency.</td><td>int</td><td>1</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>high</td></tr>

This property is required if the consumer uses either the group management functionality by using <code>subscribe(topic)</code> or the Kafka-based offset management strategy.</td><td>string</td><td>""</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>heartbeat.interval.ms</td><td>The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than <code>session.timeout.ms</code>, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value. It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.</td><td>int</td><td>3000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>max.partition.fetch.bytes</td><td>The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer. If the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this limit, the batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via <code>message.max.bytes</code> (broker config) or <code>max.message.bytes</code> (topic config). See fetch.max.bytes for limiting the consumer request size.</td><td>int</td><td>1048576</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>session.timeout.ms</td><td>The timeout used to detect consumer failures when using Kafka's group management facility. The consumer sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove this consumer from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by <code>group.min.session.timeout.ms</code> and <code>group.max.session.timeout.ms</code>.</td><td>int</td><td>10000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>fetch.max.bytes</td><td>The maximum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. Records are fetched in batches by the consumer, and if the first record batch in the first non-empty partition of the fetch is larger than this value, the record batch will still be returned to ensure that the consumer can make progress. As such, this is not a absolute maximum. The maximum record batch size accepted by the broker is defined via <code>message.max.bytes</code> (broker config) or <code>max.message.bytes</code> (topic config). Note that the consumer performs multiple fetches in parallel.</td><td>int</td><td>52428800</td><td>[0,...]</td><td>medium</td></tr>

<td>isolation.level</td><td><p>Controls how to read messages written transactionally. If set to <code>read_committed</code>, consumer.poll() will only return transactional messages which have been committed. If set to <code>read_uncommitted</code>' (the default), consumer.poll() will return all messages, even transactional messages which have been aborted. Non-transactional messages will be returned unconditionally in either mode.</p> <p>Messages will always be returned in offset order. Hence, in  <code>read_committed</code> mode, consumer.poll() will only return messages up to the last stable offset (LSO), which is the one less than the offset of the first open transaction. In particular any messages appearing after messages belonging to ongoing transactions will be withheld until the relevant transaction has been completed. As a result, <code>read_committed</code> consumers will not be able to read up to the high watermark when there are in flight transactions.</p><p> Further, when in <code>read_committed</mode> the seekToEnd method will return the LSO</td><td>string</td><td>read_uncommitted</td><td>[read_committed, read_uncommitted]</td><td>medium</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>max.poll.interval.ms</td><td>The maximum delay between invocations of poll() when using consumer group management. This places an upper bound on the amount of time that the consumer can be idle before fetching more records.

Round-robin assignment is permitted only if: (a) Every topic has the same number of streams within a consumer instance (b) The set of subscribed topics is identical for every consumer instance within the group.<p> Range partitioning works on a per-topic basis. For each topic, we lay out the available partitions in numeric order and the consumer threads in lexicographic order. We then divide the number of partitions by the total number of consumer streams (threads) to determine the number of partitions to assign to each consumer.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>bootstrap.servers</td><td>A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down).</td><td>list</td><td></td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ssl.key.password</td><td>The password of the private key in the key store file. This is optional for client.</td><td>password</td><td>null</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
