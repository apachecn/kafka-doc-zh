<td>bootstrap.servers</td><td>A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. The client will make use of all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>.

<td>heartbeat.interval.ms</td><td>The expected time between heartbeats to the group coordinator when using Kafka's group management facilities. Heartbeats are used to ensure that the worker's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new members join or leave the group.

It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.</td><td>int</td><td>3000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>

<td>rebalance.timeout.ms</td><td>The maximum allowed time for each worker to join the group once a rebalance has begun.

<tr>
<td>session.timeout.ms</td><td>The timeout used to detect worker failures. The worker sends periodic heartbeats to indicate its liveness to the broker. If no heartbeats are received by the broker before the expiration of this session timeout, then the broker will remove the worker from the group and initiate a rebalance. Note that the value must be in the allowable range as configured in the broker configuration by <code>group.min.session.timeout.ms</code> and <code>group.max.session.timeout.ms</code>.</td><td>int</td><td>10000</td><td></td><td>high</td></tr>
